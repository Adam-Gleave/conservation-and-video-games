[Evidence](https://evidence.dev/) project for visualisation of the findings of 'How commercial video games engage with biodiversity and conservation: a systematic map of literature' (Blake et al., under review).
This project provides a number of charts, maps, and tables to explore the dataset in a more digestible manner.

If you would like to run your own queries or make your own visualisations, the dataset can be found in .csv format in the `/sources/literature_db` subdirectory.
