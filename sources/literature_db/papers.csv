9,Abraham,2,Where are all the climate change games? Locating digital games’ response to climate change,"The burgeoning genre of climate fiction, or “cli-fi,” in literature and the arts has begun to attract both scholarly and popular attention. It has been described as “potentially [having] crucial contributions to make toward full understanding of the multiple, accelerating environmental challenges facing the world today” (Buell). Implicitly, these works confront the current orthodoxy about where exactly the issue of climate change sits in domains of knowledge. As Jordan notes: “climate change as ‘nature” not culture is still largely perceived as a problem for the sciences alongside planning, policy, and geography” (Jordan 8). In this paper we ask where is, or alternatively what could climate fiction look like within the field of digital games? Even a passing familiarity with the cultural output of the mainstream game industry reveals the startling omission of the issue – with very few games telling stories that engage with climate change and the unfolding ecological crisis (Abraham “Videogame Visions”). Finding a relative dearth of explicit engagement, this paper offers an alternative engagement with climate change in games by focussing on the underlying ideas, conceptions and narratives of human-environment relationships that have been a part of games since their earliest incarnations. We argue that it is possible to read games for particular conceptualisations of human relationships to nature, and offer a description of four highly prevalent “modes” of human-environment engagement. We describe and analyse these relationships for their participation in or challenge to the same issues and problems that undergird the current ecological crisis, such as enlightenment narratives of human mastery and dominion over the earth.",English,13,issn,1444-3775,4,non_empirical,2017
10,Alcott,2,GC Insights: The Anthro-Pokécene – environmental impacts echoed in the Pokémon world,"Public perception of anthropogenic environmental impacts, including climate change, is primarily driven by exposure to different forms of media. Here, we show how Pokémon, the largest multimedia franchise worldwide, mirrors public discourse in the video games’ narratives with regard to human impacts on environmental change. Pokémon demonstrates a trajectory towards greater acknowledgement of climate change and anthropogenic impacts in each released game and presents a hopeful vision for how society can adapt.",English,14,url,https://doi.org/10.5194/gc-8-47-2025,5,empirical,2025
11,Amadori,1,Video Games for Environmental Communication: Raising Awareness through Sandbox Games and Streamers,"Video games have come to play a significant role in the media habits of various generational cohorts, but particularly of the younger ones. Because of this, serious games have emerged in the past two decades as a viable way to sensitize to sociopolitical issues and today they’re employed also for sensitizing about environmental issues. This research examines the “To The Last Tree Standing” (“Ostatnie drzewo”) campaign carried out in 2017 by advertising agency Ogilvy Poland for Greenpeace to stop the deforestation of the Białowieża forest. To generate awareness among younger segments of the audience, the campaign leveraged the popularity of the sandbox video game Minecraft, within which a 1:1 digital copy of the forest was developed, and of famous Polish videogame “streamers” (i.e. people broadcasting their gameplay sessions). Methodologically, the research relied on interviews to executives and designers (n=4), as well as content analysis of the campaign and related discourses in Polish media (n=19). The findings suggest that a) sandbox games can generate innovative storytelling practices overcoming the political polarization of environmental communication; b) sandbox games as Minecraft, thanks to the high degree of manipulation of its worlds and the freedom of creation it allows, represent a salient framework for the meaning-making of ecological facts; c) streamers represent an “educational leverage” for the development of ecological attitudes. This evidence highlights new development trajectories for the study of environmental communication.",English,15,url,https://doi.org/10.26350/001200_000103,6,empirical,2020
12,Bianchi,1,A Field Guide to Monsters: Practices of Wildlife Watching in Video Games,"Studies in ecocriticism demonstrate the potential of mainstream video games to offer diverse and rigorous considerations for the nonhuman. Continuing conversations about how these artifacts present the nonhuman, this chapter examines games such as New Pokémon Snap and Monster Hunter Rise, which emphasize observing and photographing nonhuman creatures. Specifically, the chapter asks, How do these games characterize practices of observing and documenting wildlife? What do they teach players about producing and circulating wildlife images? To offer answers, the chapter connects video game analyses to beliefs and practices about visually reproducing actual animals. Ultimately, these games demonstrate how video game play might reify troubling aspects of the human–animal divide while also supporting critical perspectives about players’ ecological agency towards the nonhuman.",English,16,url,https://doi.org/10.2307/jj.10819591.30,3,non_empirical,2024
