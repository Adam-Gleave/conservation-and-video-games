9,Abraham,2,Where are all the climate change games? Locating digital games’ response to climate change,"The burgeoning genre of climate fiction, or “cli-fi,” in literature and the arts has begun to attract both scholarly and popular attention. It has been described as “potentially [having] crucial contributions to make toward full understanding of the multiple, accelerating environmental challenges facing the world today” (Buell). Implicitly, these works confront the current orthodoxy about where exactly the issue of climate change sits in domains of knowledge. As Jordan notes: “climate change as ‘nature” not culture is still largely perceived as a problem for the sciences alongside planning, policy, and geography” (Jordan 8). In this paper we ask where is, or alternatively what could climate fiction look like within the field of digital games? Even a passing familiarity with the cultural output of the mainstream game industry reveals the startling omission of the issue – with very few games telling stories that engage with climate change and the unfolding ecological crisis (Abraham “Videogame Visions”). Finding a relative dearth of explicit engagement, this paper offers an alternative engagement with climate change in games by focussing on the underlying ideas, conceptions and narratives of human-environment relationships that have been a part of games since their earliest incarnations. We argue that it is possible to read games for particular conceptualisations of human relationships to nature, and offer a description of four highly prevalent “modes” of human-environment engagement. We describe and analyse these relationships for their participation in or challenge to the same issues and problems that undergird the current ecological crisis, such as enlightenment narratives of human mastery and dominion over the earth.",English,13,issn,1444-3775,4,non_empirical,2017
10,Alcott,2,GC Insights: The Anthro-Pokécene – environmental impacts echoed in the Pokémon world,"Public perception of anthropogenic environmental impacts, including climate change, is primarily driven by exposure to different forms of media. Here, we show how Pokémon, the largest multimedia franchise worldwide, mirrors public discourse in the video games’ narratives with regard to human impacts on environmental change. Pokémon demonstrates a trajectory towards greater acknowledgement of climate change and anthropogenic impacts in each released game and presents a hopeful vision for how society can adapt.",English,14,url,https://doi.org/10.5194/gc-8-47-2025,5,empirical,2025
11,Amadori,1,Video Games for Environmental Communication: Raising Awareness through Sandbox Games and Streamers,"Video games have come to play a significant role in the media habits of various generational cohorts, but particularly of the younger ones. Because of this, serious games have emerged in the past two decades as a viable way to sensitize to sociopolitical issues and today they’re employed also for sensitizing about environmental issues. This research examines the “To The Last Tree Standing” (“Ostatnie drzewo”) campaign carried out in 2017 by advertising agency Ogilvy Poland for Greenpeace to stop the deforestation of the Białowieża forest. To generate awareness among younger segments of the audience, the campaign leveraged the popularity of the sandbox video game Minecraft, within which a 1:1 digital copy of the forest was developed, and of famous Polish videogame “streamers” (i.e. people broadcasting their gameplay sessions). Methodologically, the research relied on interviews to executives and designers (n=4), as well as content analysis of the campaign and related discourses in Polish media (n=19). The findings suggest that a) sandbox games can generate innovative storytelling practices overcoming the political polarization of environmental communication; b) sandbox games as Minecraft, thanks to the high degree of manipulation of its worlds and the freedom of creation it allows, represent a salient framework for the meaning-making of ecological facts; c) streamers represent an “educational leverage” for the development of ecological attitudes. This evidence highlights new development trajectories for the study of environmental communication.",English,15,url,https://doi.org/10.26350/001200_000103,6,empirical,2020
12,Bianchi,1,A Field Guide to Monsters: Practices of Wildlife Watching in Video Games,"Studies in ecocriticism demonstrate the potential of mainstream video games to offer diverse and rigorous considerations for the nonhuman. Continuing conversations about how these artifacts present the nonhuman, this chapter examines games such as New Pokémon Snap and Monster Hunter Rise, which emphasize observing and photographing nonhuman creatures. Specifically, the chapter asks, How do these games characterize practices of observing and documenting wildlife? What do they teach players about producing and circulating wildlife images? To offer answers, the chapter connects video game analyses to beliefs and practices about visually reproducing actual animals. Ultimately, these games demonstrate how video game play might reify troubling aspects of the human–animal divide while also supporting critical perspectives about players’ ecological agency towards the nonhuman.",English,16,url,https://doi.org/10.2307/jj.10819591.30,3,non_empirical,2024

17,Abraham,1,What Is an Ecological Game?,"This chapter asks what a truly ecological game looks like. It begins by considering the ecological resonances present in the terms used to describe certain kinds of environmental relationships in games. Considering the survival-crafting genre, often held up as a paragon of environmental interactions, the chapter examines the conventions of this genre and examines their implications, reevaluating their resemblance to environmental and ecological notions. Despite presenting bucolic natural environments and dynamics the chapter argues that these games are suffused with economic dynamics and the logic of capitalist accumulation. It argues for extending the ecological thought to encompass the context of game production and the sites of play that form the material conditions of gaming, concluding that the truly ecological game must be aware of and actively mitigate the harms involved in its own production, from carbon emission to plastics and rare earth metals.",English,42,url,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-91705-0_3,4,non_empirical,2022

19,Attebery,1,Coshaping Digital and Biological Animals: Companion Species Encounters and Biopower in the Video Games Pikmin and Pokémon,"This paper considers how video games featuring animals as biological resources are simulating the types of “messy coshapings” that Donna Haraway values in companion species relationships, despite relocating these coshapings to a digital environment. The two game franchises that I am using for this argument—Pikmin and Pokémon—feature animal-like digital creatures who can be situated alongside biological animals through their imbrication in similar biopolitical structures of pet ownership, breeding and genetic manipulation, and animal training. I argue that embodied relationships of dominance and biopower become recoded in these digital spaces through a process similar to Eugene Thacker’s “biological exchanges,” where biology becomes both material and immaterial through processes like bioinformatics. In these two game worlds, biological exchanges occur through the tension between the player’s instrumentalization of animal biopower and the depiction of these creatures as affective and vulnerable. By emphasizing the vulnerability of digital animals under a system of biopower, Pikmin and Pokémon invite the player to decode her experiences managing immaterial, digital animal populations in order to rethink her relationships with embodied, biological animals.",English,159,url,https://doi.org/10.52537/humanimalia.9912,3,non_empirical,2015

22,Backe,1,Within the Mainstream: An Ecocritical Framework for Digital Game History,"Ecocriticism of digital games has so far engaged with a rather small corpus of examples, often prescriptively and with a quite limited methodological toolkit. This essay systematizes and historicizes some of these commonly found limitations of past research and proposes methods for a more historically and generically diverse exploration of ecological thinking vis-à-vis digital games. The majority of discussions of games from an ecocritical perspective has applied concepts and frameworks borrowed from literature and film studies, thus privileging surface semiotics over game mechanics. More methodically aware studies have oriented themselves toward the popular framework of procedural rhetoric (Bogost 2007), resulting both in a selection bias towards serious games and an author-centric, intentionalist slant inherent in the approach. In general, the discussion revolves around a small number of games with apparent ecocritical potential, such as Myst (Cyan 1993) or Farmville (Zynga 2009), resulting in a selective, a-historic and therefore distorted discussion of ecology in the diverse medium of digital games. This essay discusses strategies for dealing with a larger corpus of digital games through a descriptive matrix for identifying and analyzing the ecological dimension of digital games. It proposes an extension of the ecocritical toolkit by including a more user-centered, ethics-based theoretical framework based on Sicart’s Ethics of Computer Games (2009). The gain of engaging with representation and simulation of the natural environment in mainstream computer game history will be demonstrated in an analysis of two paradigmatic games. In both Red Dead Redemption (Rockstar San Diego 2010) and Dishonored (Arkane Studios 2013), we encounter game design geared toward producing ludo-narrative dissonances which are highly inductive of critical engagement with the ecosphere.",English,143,url,https://doi.org/10.37536/ECOZONA.2017.8.2.1362,39,non_empirical,2017

It then considers the limited scholarship engaging the intersections of digital games and nonhuman animals. The essay uses this literature to perform a textual analysis of theHunter: Call of the Wild as a case study contributing to broader discussions of the mediation of nonhuman animals in digital games. The paper specifically focuses on the game’s mediation of an ethics of hunting. The game’s missions mediate hunting anthropocentrically, while its rules represent a hunting style that is in accordance with the hunting community’s self-proclaimed care for nonhuman animals. The essay thereby makes a contribution to the meager research on the relationship between human and nonhuman animals in digital games.",English,214,url,https://doi.org/10.1163/15685306-bja10174,3,non_empirical,2024
24,Bainbridge,1,'It is a Pokémon world': The Pokémon franchise and the environment,"Originating in 1996, Pokémon has become the second most successful game-based franchise in the world and arguably one of the best known examples of transmedia storytelling in youth media today. Based around creator Satoshi Tajiri’s love of insect collecting, Pokémon imagines a world where wild creatures exist to be collected, trained and battle with one another. Such an ideology, simultaneously embracing both the conservation and consumption of nature, is emblematic of the larger challenges Japan has had to negotiate as a nation trying to balance economic development and environmental protection. In this way, this article argues that, when subjected to textual analysis, the Pokémon franchise can function as vernacular theory, interrogating the relationship between environmentalism, materialism and sustainable development, a series of popular youth media texts engaging with issues and subjects that are usually reserved for academia.",English,164,url,https://doi.org/10.1177/1367877913501240,4,non_empirical,2014

Yet, in modern society, artificial constructs and electronic technology now dominate most peoples’ interests (technophilia). This has led to a perceived growing disconnection between humans and nature.We ask howsuch technology might be harnessed as an agent of connection to the environment, rather than being seen as a driver of detachment. We use the example of a hugely popular mobile augmented reality smartphone game “Ingress” to show how gaming technology can excite people about nature, unlock their inherent biophilia, and highlight the value of ecological restoration in their everyday lives.",English,204,url,https://doi.org/10.1111/rec.12387,4,non_empirical,2016
25,Baker,1,"Civilization and Its Contents: Procedural Rhetoric, Nationalism, and Civilization V","Computer, video, and mobile games have become a dominant presence in popular culture. However, the nature and extent of the rhetorical work games perform is not fully understood. The content and form of games differs from older media in ways that make it difficult to understand how they contribute to public discourses and shape worldviews. The difference is that games derive their rhetorical force from their procedural, rather than their narrative, content. Games make their arguments through the rules and mechanics of the game. These procedures both encourage and require the player to engage with the game in ways that reinforce the arguments being made through the procedures. In this thesis, I contribute to two scholarly conversations through an examination of the computer game Civilization V. The first is a theorization of what features of a game’s procedures make them persuasive. The second is an exploration of the ways Civilization V informs and shapes the exigent discussions surrounding nuclear proliferation and climate change. I argue that the procedural rhetorics of Civilization V make persuasive arguments in favor of nationalistic nuclear and climate policies.",English,105,url,https://digitalcollections.sdsu.edu/do/d470e56a-f04d-49ec-a950-95a8925cf205#mode/2up,3,non_empirical,2017

The hope is that this critical exploration can work as a starting point for social justice education about environmental racism and relationality from Indigenous worldviews (specifically those of the Néhiyaw, the Iñupiat, and the Haudenosaunee).

By performing a reading of rhetoric and technological recapture in Electronic Arts’s (EA’s) The Sims series, the essay untangles how game design and game technology reflect ideologies – sometimes even conflicting ones – about how humans should relate to and interact with nature. This essay also argues that advancements in digital game technology afford designers and players the option to explore and perpetuate more complex and diverse ideologies about humans and nature that move away from anthropocentric and speciesist perspectives.",English,154,url,https://doi.org/10.1080/14688417.2014.963881,3,non_empirical,2014
31,Bianchi,1,Simulated Species: The Question of the Animal in Digital Games,"While scholars examine how art, literature, and film shape concepts of the animal, the recent proliferation of computer technologies demands research investigating how the digital mediates notions of a human-animal divide. Digital games, as transmedial objects and as medium, offer one significant avenue for such explorations. As media studies and animal studies scholar Tom Tyler observes, the unique properties of games allow players nuanced and insightful engagements with animal ontology, otherness, and agency. Still, representations of animals in digital games remain mostly neglected by scholarship in animal studies, game studies, and other related fields. This dissertation attempts to address this paucity of scholarship by providing an interdisciplinary approach to reading animal representations within the medium. Simulated Species argues for scholarly engagement with animal representations in specific computer game genres. The project proposes a framework for understanding how different genres address animals by drawing on the works of media studies scholars such as Terry Harpold, Ian Bogost, Alexander Galloway, and others. Scholarship in animal studies, posthumanist theory, play theory, and game studies inform my analysis of how storytelling, user interfaces, and game mechanics respond to dominant discourses about animals. In reading several games, such as Zoo Tycoon (2013), Goat Simulator (2014), Splatoon (2015), and others, Simulated Species argues that some games uniquely model nuanced understandings of animal ontology and human-animal biopolitics, suggesting ethical approaches to both human-animal interactions and to game design. The first chapter of this project reviews relevant scholarship, each subsequent chapter attends to distinct game genres. The first and second body chapters examine genres that cast players as human characters and simulate their institutional and individual interactions with nonhuman species. The fourth and fifth chapters explore games that (re)imagine human-animal relations through games that have players play as (rather than with) digital animals. These latter games can teach players to acknowledge and appreciate biological others beyond the confines of the game world while also challenging notions of the player as predominantly, if not exclusively, human.",English,105,url,https://ufdc.ufl.edu/UFE0052485/00001,3,non_empirical,2018
32,Bianchi,1,Ecoplay: The rhetorics of games about nature,"This chapter focuses on an alternative framework for analyzing how games make arguments about nature, the environment, and ecologies. Locating digital games and play within broader discursive and rhetorical ecologies through ecoplay can further illuminate how digital games cultivate environmental awareness; continue to establish the importance of green game studies to ecocriticism and game studies; and change how we play, analyze, and design games about nature. Game studies scholars; however, have highlighted several rhetorical qualities of games, such as their interactivity and their ability to model alternative possibilities that require specialized frameworks for rhetorical ecocriticism. Play theory is useful for rhetorical ecocriticism because it considers the interactions between players’ beliefs and the values presented to players through game systems. The meditation statues in ABZU introduce players to environmental rhetorics that negotiate between different ideas of nature. Ecoplay, through its connections to ecospeak and ecosee, can situate the rhetorics of computer games within broader media ecologies.",English,51,isbn,9780429399121,3,non_empirical,2019
33,Bianchi,1,Beyond Barren Wastelands: The Greening of the Post-apocalypse in Video Games,"Video games often depict post-apocalyptic environments characterized by loss and destruction. Some video games, however, challenge this paradigm through representations of lush greenery and thriving gardens that signify environmental recuperation in the wake of world-ending devastation. This essay explores how these virtual worlds engage with ecological recovery and connection by drawing on critical plant studies and scholarship about video games as ecomedia. Specifically, the essay analyzes two video games: Plants vs. Zombies and Cloud Gardens. Despite their different mechanics and aesthetics, both games envision speculative futures where vegetation thrives in the post-Anthropocene. Plants vs. Zombies tasks players with amassing an army of formidable foliage to combat hordes of the living dead, while Cloud Gardens prompts players to cultivate flora in neglected manufactured landscapes. In each game, plants are cast as vital agents in shaping the environment, encouraging players to critically consider nonhuman ontology and humans’ ecological entanglements. These playful plantings also reflect on practices concerning resource scarcity, sustainability, and related environmental issues. In examining these games, the essay demonstrates the potential for video games to promote ecocritical or “green” perspectives through the post-Anthropocene, posthuman, and post-apocalypse.",English,176,url,"https://gamescriticism.org/2024/09/06/bianchi-6-a/#:~:text=This%20essay%20explores%20how%20these,Zombies%20and%20Cloud%20Gardens.",3,non_empirical,2024

Scholars have demonstrated how games as speculative fictions can encourage players to acknowledge animal embodiment and agency as well as how games (mis)represent and challenge real-world human–animal interactions. Still, scholarship about representations of animals in video games remains relatively scarce and primarily focused on specific styles and genres of games despite a plethora of diverse animal character designs. This chapter broadens studies of animals in video games by attending to their designs in two-dimensional action and adventure games, specifically Frogger (1981) and The Plan (2013). By examining these games as works of speculative fiction, this chapter identifies how they imagine the marginalized position of animals in the Anthropocene and reflects on the broader implications of these artifacts for developers creating video games that critically consider animals.",English,35,url,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-41695-8_4,3,non_empirical,2024
35,Bledstein,1,Gaming Together: The Communal Journey in Upper One Games’ Never Alone,"This paper examines Upper One Games’ Never Alone, or Kisima Inŋitchuŋa, as an aesthetic expression of cultural pride, communal engagement, and broader collectivity. The game, developed in conjunction with the Cook Inlet Tribal Council, a non-profit indigenous organization working in Alaska, tells the story of Iñupiat girl Nuna. Along with her Arctic fox companion, she leaves her village to seek the source of a blizzard that ravages her tribe’s community. The basic elements of the plot stem from the ancient Iñupiat myth “Kunuuksaayuka”. In addition to these mythological elements, there are video interviews with members of the Iñupiat throughout the game in which they provide players with information about the tribe’s customs, traditions, and relationship with the land. Nuna’s expedition and the cultural material surrounding it demonstrate the vitality of the Iñupiat and encourage relationships with the community. The game’s themes of survival and communal responsibility reflect the Iñupiat’s experiences in contemporary Alaska and cultural values. Beyond the expression of Iñupiat culture within Never Alone’s basic structure, cooperative play mode, in which one player plays as Nuna and another plays as the fox, allows for a particularly powerful experience of togetherness. Their journey combines folkloric material with the formal capacities of video games to engage audiences with cultural traditions and practices. Never Alone is a vital artistic contribution to awareness and collectivity within and beyond the Iñupiat community.",English,208,url,https://doi.org/10.24877/rt.12,8,non_empirical,2017

I draw on sociologist Anthony Giddens’ notion of “ontological security” – which refers to our sense of stability and safety that we draw from continuous, and therefore reliable, predictable, unthreatening, and familiar sequences of events or activities happening in our everyday lives – and propose the concept of “cozy agency” to productively examine the aesthetics of games that are not characterized by a hypermasculine drive to successfully overcome challenges, nor by the inessentiality of player action typical of idle games. Research on lifestyle media, cuteness, and vegetal affect is put into dialogue to theorize the modalities of agency typical cozy game aesthetics can afford and constrain. Such an approach is in line with recent shifts in discourses of agency and interactivity in game studies, which criticize these two terms for being too binary, masculine, and not accommodating alternative forms of engagement with games, with recent scholarship on agency especially calling for a politicization of the term and a call to delve into the significance of meaningful empowerment to act in/with/on/through games.",English,203,url,https://doi.org/10.18778/2391-8551.11.04,5,non_empirical,2024
38,Bohunicky,1,Ecocomposition: Writing ecologies in digital games,"This paper contributes to digital writing studies and the emergent field of game composition by exploring how writing in the PC and console editions of Mojang Studio’s Minecraft reconciles putative antagonisms between nature and technology. I suggest that writing in Minecraft models Sidney I. Dobrin and Christian Weisser’s concept of ‘ecocomposition’, which theorises that nature and discourse are coconstituents. Players’ discourse consists of the rocks, trees, dirt, water and biological matter, and this discursive matter provides a set of symbols with which they can write shelter, tools and media. Additionally, I suggest that Minecraft’s writing technology entangles writing surface and practice with nature by extending the surface of the ‘crafting grid’ across its environment. I conclude that while Minecraft’s model of ecocomposition encourages writing studies of digital games that show the connections between writing, nature and materiality, much of this early eco-game media is entrenched in Cartesian notions of plant, animal and mineral agency that reduces ecological complexity.",English,154,url,https://doi.org/10.1080/14688417.2014.964283,3,non_empirical,2014
39,Bohunicky,1,Ecomods: An Ecocritical Approach to Game Modification,"As systems that model complex relationships, digital games encourage players to enact Morton''s '"ecological thought'" through the actions players perform within the game world. Yet these representations, as Alenda Chang (2011) has noted, '"commit at least one if not all of the following missteps in their realization of in-game environments: relegating environment to background scenery, relying on stereotyped landscapes, and predicating player success on extraction and use of natural resources'" (58). In other words, the flora and fauna players find are often reduced to non-interactive set pieces, thereby stripping actions of the ecological and environmental impact they could have. Despite these problems, ecocritical approaches to digital games have sought to re-assert the significance of connections between game ecologies and their environmental representations by tracing cultural associations (Bianchi, Barton), and by investigating problems with materiality and waste (Apperley and Jayemanne). This essay builds on these approaches by considering “modding,” short for “modifications,” as an area for ecocritical intervention in the flattening of games'' environmental representations. Specifically, this essay examines the thriving environmental modding communities around Bethesda Softworks’ The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Although some of the mods released for Skyrim emphasize visual enhancements, others re-connect players to the game’s ecology and environment in meaningful ways.",English,143,url,https://doi.org/10.37536/ECOZONA.2017.8.2.1352,3,non_empirical,2017

This paper defines the distinct staging of untamed and pristine environment in open world games as striated wilderness which is constituted by aesthetics and gazing regimes of Western culture as well as by modularity and variability of computer games as data bases. Merging the wilderness discourse with concepts of tourist gaze and prospect-refuge theory, rural open world games can be analyzed as rhythmized liminal spaces of the man-nature dichotomy. Thus, they stand in the tradition of landscape gardens and nature parks where former survival instincts and urges for exploration are experienced for recreation and entertainment. Striated wilderness has to be differentiated between place (wilderness) and practice (wildness).

It begins by examining the intersection of citizen science and digital gaming, specifically initiatives that have enabled global communities to contribute to ecosystem preservation efforts through collaborative data collection, analysis, and problem-solving that have been vital for monitoring marine habitats. Building upon these developments, we will explore how digital games share parallels with mesocosms, attempting to render ecological and Earth systems phenomena legible while simultaneously contributing to contemporary debates surrounding biodiversity, species loss, and climate change. Notably, digital gameworlds have expanded their scope beyond simple ecological simulations, incorporating intricate climate models alongside social, political, and historical elements to craft nuanced, evolving virtual environments that attempt to reflect the fragile interconnection of systems on a planetary scale.",English,226,url,https://doi.org/10.46938/tv.2024.626,37,non_empirical,2024
43,Brown,1,The Garden in the Machine: Video Games and Environmental Consciousness,"“The Garden in the Machine” looks at how video games might raise environmental consciousness and compel thought about human-environment relations. Although games are deeply embedded within networks of exploitation and environmental degradation, they might provide a basis for thinking environmental issues in three ways: as procedural arguments, as spatial allegory, and as simulated, ethically disposed boredom. While independent games like Fort McMoney (2014) attempt to overtly intervene in discourses about oil, energy, and environmental degradation, many popular games like Far Cry 4 (2014) offer a more complex simulation of natural spaces that might be read as allegories for the discursive position of “nature” in modern society. Finally, a third type of game, exemplified by Proteus (2013), forces its users to withhold from the violent exploitation of nature, compelling instead a contemplative attitude toward the world.",English,193,url,https://www.proquest.com/docview/1698103038/fulltext/A30ABC70A0A347DFPQ/1?accountid=13042&sourcetype=Scholarly%20Journals,,non_empirical,2014
45,Burton,1,"Vibrant Media Matter: Video Games, Social Media and Ecological Justice","This thesis builds a framework for media studies that is better able to address the role of media in issues of environmental and ecological justice. Rooted in Jane Bennett’s “vibrant materialism,” this framework critiques subject-object orientations in order to break down ontological heirarchies of matter that center humans to instead regard all matter (including meda matter) as coequal, coactant, and vibrant. Media has the potential to reflect and reproduce our most ecologically destructive ideologies, but also to mediate and reshape a relationship with our environment and ecology that is more sustainable and just for both human and nonhuman entities. All our media things—video game worlds, computer hardware, social media platforms—have ecologically capacities. For media and media studies to address issues of ecological justice, media scholars, makers, and consumers must reckon with the capacities of nonhuman things and our ecological relationship with them. Using Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild as its primary case study, this project pulls together literature from a variety of disciplines, including posthumanism, video game studies, fan studies, and environmental studies. It applies its vibrant materialist framework to Breath of the Wild as a video game text, as well as to online engagement in connection with the game, IRL engagment with real-world environments, and the ecological threats those environments face. Highlighting the affective force (the “thing-power,” as Bennett would say) of nonhuman things and places—from Hyrulian forests, to r/Zelda Reddit threads, to the real-world neighborhoods of players and watersheds of the Great Salt Lake—this project consdiers how the affects of humans and nonhumans reverberate across the boundaries of the virtual and the physical, of nature and culture, affectively tieing us and our media things into a vibrant material ecology—for better or worse. This project posits that we are “vibrant cyborgs”—human selves rife with the affects of nonhumanity, affectively interwoven with both our technologies, our fictions, and the “natural” world. Lastly, this project suggests some further directions for future ecomedia research to explore.",English,105,url,http://dx.doi.org/10.26153/tsw/48122,3,non_empirical,2023
46,Butucea,1,Gaming as Everything. Challenging the Anthropocene through Nomadic Performativity,"In this article I will discuss David OReilly’s video game Everything (2017), suggesting that its unique dramaturgy portrays an ecology in which the human is seen as forging alliances and interconnections with the non-human. Set in a seemingly infinite open-world environment, the game revolves around the player exploring vast digital landscapes from the vantage point of multiple nonhuman avatars. Wandering about with no defined goal or direction, I played as animals, plants, rocks, continents, and even galaxies, shifting from one state to the next and making unexpected alliances along the way. Employing Audronė Žukauskaitė’s concept of “nomadic performativity” (2015), I will suggest that the game’s dramaturgy invites the player to imagine the human as deeply embedded in a wide system of interaction with non-human others, as an immanent part of an ecosystem, rather than a transcendental being outside of it. In articulating this idea, Everything puts forward a theatrical critique of the human domination and othering of the natural environment that underpins and drives the Anthropocene.",English,188,url,https://doi.org/10.7146/nts.v32i1.120413,5,non_empirical,2020

After introducing this strand of “animal mayhem games,” my paper links it to recent arguments on human-nonhuman entanglement in times of ecological crisis. Games like Goat Simulator, Deeeer Simulator and Tokyo Jungle ask players to engage with an animal avatar while simultaneously unsettling dichotomies between human societies and nonhuman phenomena. The destabilization of anthropocentric assumptions, I argue, is the deeper significance of animal mayhem. The subversive fun generated by these games speaks to core ideas of nonhuman-oriented thinking, particularly Timothy Morton’s concept of “strange stranger.” My close readings of Goat Simulator and Untitled Goose Game focus on the intersection of nonhuman agency and generic templates drawn from open world and puzzle games, respectively.",English,224,url,https://gamestudies.org/2101/articles/caracciolo,7,non_empirical,2021

In reality, however, it draws on the entirety of the franchise, including thematic elements which stretch from the series’ most well-known title Final Fantasy VII through Final Fantasy XIV and even XVI, especially the consequences of human technological progress on the environment. Following Alenda Chang’s call to examine how video games might intersect with or contribute to environmental consciousness, this chapter argues that both Stranger and its precursor situate themselves as stories of ecological collapse, and the narrative interventions in the newer title specifically call into question technogaianism, a form of “bright green” environmentalism which sees technology as an indispensable tool in remedying environmental harms rather than simply the cause of them. The chapter explains technogaianism, draws attention to relevant comparisons in other ludonarratives, and conducts an analysis of both ludic and narrative elements in each Final Fantasy title under discussion, concluding that the games are ultimately ambivalent about the role technology should play.",English,75,url,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-67980-3_8,3,non_empirical,2024

Although in some respects a critique of computer-generated plants as invasive simulacra proves valid, I also attempt to demonstrate their value as emblems of conflicting approaches to vital simulation—in most cases, digital plants remain largely static representational objects produced as if ex nihilo by design software, but in others, they are formulated from the start as changeable, process-driven, and susceptible to outside conditions. Increasingly ubiquitous, digital plants pose unique and edifying challenges to scholars of environmental media, artists, scientists, and general audiences, as well as the reigning narrow standard of graphical realism in computer simulation.",English,144,url,https://doi.org/10.7273/wtdf-7w30,3,non_empirical,2019

If models shape what is knowable and which actions can be taken, how might a closer attention to modeling—specifically, natural modeling in the worlds of digital games—encourage us to reevaluate our relationships to electronic artifacts and the biosphere? Drawing on work in data justice and digital modeling, this essay reflects on whether existing modeling resources, such as popular digital asset libraries, largely replicate the anthropocentric and cultural biases of the people that make them. A brief examination of player modification practices and two projects, Wao Kanaka and the Taiwan Digital Asset Library, suggests ways that games can include greater ecological and cultural variability while broadening access to the tools and practices of asset creation.",English,131,url,https://doi.org/10.1353/con.2024.a924130,3,non_empirical,2024
57,Cheyne,9,The power of gibbon songs: Going beyond the research to inform conservation actions,"Gibbons (Hylobatidae) are the smallest of the apes, known for their arboreal behavior and stereotyped songs. These species and sex-specific songs are often the subject of detailed studies regarding their evolution, responses to changing environments, involvement in social behavior, and used to design vocalization‐based survey techniques to monitor population densities and trends. What is poorly understood is the value and impact of using the science and sound of gibbon vocalization and gibbon stories in education and outreach to complement nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) efforts. We present an example of how Borneo Nature Foundation, a NGOs based in Indonesia, is working to use the recordings of the songs of Bornean white‐bearded gibbons (Hylobates albibarbis) to inform conservation actions and education efforts. Gibbons in Indonesia are often poorly known or understood by the public compared to orangutans (Pongo spp). We showcase how a field of study, namely primate acoustics, is an untapped resource to create digital content to engage with local, national and international communities and can be developed into educational tools in the form of storytelling, mobile apps and games, to highlight the plight of these threatened species and how to conserve them.",English,119,url,https://doi.org/10.1002/ajp.23626,5,non_empirical,2024

Games can use companionship between the player and the environment as a way of establishing empathy that can then be applied to their real life. Representations of the environment and animals in some games can inadvertently lend itself towards messages of conservation, while other games explicitly attempt to disseminate this message. Just as many games inadvertently represent the environment as something to exploit or as a potential companion, texts can also encourage acts and attitudes of conservation. Ecocriticism can be used to analyze any game featuring environments and creatures.

63,Condis,1,"Sorry, Wrong Apocalypse: Horizon Zero Dawn, Heaven’s Vault, and the Ecocritical Videogame","Climate change is arguably the most pressing threat the globe has ever faced. And yet despite (or perhaps, in part, because of) its urgency, science communicators have found it quite difficult to convey this threat effectively to the broader public. While Guerrilla Games’s Horizon Zero Dawn (2017) does an excellent job of creating opportunities for players to reflect on ecocritical themes, the disconnect that exists between its plot and its core gameplay loops somewhat blunt its effectiveness as an instrument of activism. In particular, its emphasis on combat diverts attention from what Rob Nixon (2011) calls the “slow violence” of climate change in favor of escapist power fantasies. I suggest that this disconnect between the game’s mechanics and its themes point to the need to invent new modes of interaction more suited to showcasing the unprecedentedscale upon which cli-fi stories take place. As one potential model of a relevant mechanic, I would like to nominate inkle’s Heaven’s Vault (2019), an “archeogame” (Reinhard, 2018) in which the impact of events long distant in time and space reverberate into the future and the only way to fight back against a cataclysmic environmental disaster is to understand the entrenched political and ideological institutions that brought it into existence over the course of millennia as well as the place of the individual within those institutions as potential agents of change.",English,224,url,https://gamestudies.org/2003/articles/condis,3,non_empirical,2020
64,Costanza,20,"Simulation games that integrate research, entertainment, and learning around ecosystem services","Humans currently spend over 3 billion person-hours per week playing computer games. Most of these games are purely for entertainment, but use of computer games for education has also expanded dramatically. At the same time, experimental games have become a staple of social science research but have depended on relatively small sample sizes and simple, abstract situations, limiting their range and applicability. If only a fraction of the time spent playing computer games could be harnessed for research, it would open up a huge range of new opportunities. We review the use of games in research, education, and entertainment and develop ideas for integrating these three functions around the idea of ecosystem services valuation. This approach to valuation can be seen as aversion of choice modeling that allows players to generate their own scenarios taking account of the trade-offs embedded in the game, rather than simply ranking preformed scenarios. We outline a prototype game called “Lagom Island” to test the proposition that gaming can be used to reveal the value of ecosystem services. Our prototype provides a potential pathway and functional building blocks for approaching the relatively untapped potential of games in the context of ecosystem services research.",English,142,url,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2014.10.001,4,non_empirical,2014
65,Crowley,1,Playing farmer: At the intersections of neo-liberal capitalism and ecocriticism in Stardew Valley,"Eric Barone’s 2016 indie ‘country life simulator’ video game Stardew Valley has yet to be evaluated through the dual lenses of neo-liberal capitalism and ecocriticism. Given his intention for the game to have real-world messages, including the importance of community organization against corporate domination and of environmental conservation, there is a need to evaluate the intent and execution of his vision to determine if the resulting gameplay truly conveys those messages to his audience. This article draws on neo-liberal capitalist video game theory, or the simulation of capitalist circuits in video games as theorized by Kline and Golumbia, and ecocritical video game theory, or environmental modelling strategies in video games as discussed by Chang and Condis, to argue that video games are political texts, that the game mechanics within demonstrate the process-oriented ‘work as play’ mentality that simulates capitalist circuits and that the misrepresentation of environmentality through selective reproduction of real-world processes detrimentally impacts the agency and responsibility of consumers of video games. After engaging in an analysis of Barone’s representations of the in-game economy and environment via the player character’s origin story, methods of production, community organization and environmental interactions, this article concludes with a final discussion about the limitations of video game design, defence of Barone’s intent and execution and submission of suggestions for improvement and reflections on future study.",English,21,url,https://doi.org/10.1386/jgvw_00069_1,3,non_empirical,2024

By encouraging players to go outside and consider various aspects of virtual species’ biology, the game could increase awareness and engagement with real-world nature. However, interacting with Pokémon could alternatively encourage exploitation of wildlife or replace players’ desire to interact with real-world nature. We suggest a number of ways in which Pokémon Go could be adapted to increase its conservation impact, and how new conservation-orientated AR games could be created.

72,Dragomir,1,One Does Not Simply Play a Game: Tapping into Game Worlds as Cultural Texts,"As a widely used, popular medium, digital games successfully circulate a variety of narratives, discourses, and practices among highly diverse audiences. While games are often riddled with references, players sometimes encounter narratives that draw on recent or more distant pasts, or that engender connections with contemporary issues and topics. This paper explores how digital games may be read, studied, and crafted as cultural texts. I argue that games have the potential to address and document topics and concerns that are contextual to and reflect discourses which are prominent in the public imaginary. I begin by clarifying what I mean when I speak of digital games as cultural texts. Then, I draw on Sanford, Hopper, and Burren’s expanded definition of intertextuality, as they propose that game texts connect to a wide range of other types of texts, including lived experiences (Sanford, Hopper, and Burren 2016). I move on to quests, random encounters, and the combat system from the game The Elder Scrolls Online (ZOS 2014), for examining how referencing the real world illustrates the intertextual character of digital games, as well as their worth as cultural texts. My close reading of the game intersects with literature on digital games concerned with historical problem spaces (McCall 2022), ecocriticism (Remesal and Manuel 2019; Backe 2017), neoliberal subjectivities (Patterson 2014; Voorhees 2009), and procedural rhetoric (Bogost 2007). I conclude by revisiting Sanford, Hopper, and Burren’s arguments for a complex learning system that draws on the intertextuality inherent in digital games, and I outline additional affordances specific to the medium that could be imagined in pedagogical spaces.",English,138,url,https://doi.org/10.16995/dscn.11059,38,non_empirical,2025
73,du Plessis,1,The becoming-flower of video games: a Deleuzoguattarian analysis of Thatgamecompany’s Flower (2009),"Current prominent theoretical approaches within the field of video game studies tend to engage with video games in terms of narrative and gameplay because of the legacy of narratology and ludology. However, these approaches are potentially ill-equipped to adequately account for the specificity of certain video games that involve digital interactive experiences that are not primarily, or solely, focused on narrative or gameplay, but can rather be understood as video game multiplicities that consist of percepts and affects. A pertinent example of a game that functions as a video game multiplicity is Thatgamecompany’s Flower (2009), which is analysed through a Deleuzoguattarian lens in order to highlight the unique aesthetic and play elements, or ‘percepts’ and ‘affects’, that enable the potentially transformative experiences offered by the game. Theorisation of these elements is arguably important because they entail a movement beyond the essence-based representational models of video games that are generally advanced through narratology and ludology, toward a model of multiplicity and becoming. In particular, the article explores how the percepts and affects of Flower can potentially open the player to a form of “transversal becoming” known as “becoming-imperceptible”.",English,161,url,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336083457_The_becoming-flower_of_video_games_a_Deleuzoguattarian_analysis_of_Thatgamecompany's_Flower_2009,10,non_empirical,2018

But the question must be asked, how accurate are these mediums to the accident and area that they portray? The Chernobyl accident not only led to the deaths of thousands of people and displaced thousands of others, but it permanently impacted the environment around the town of Pripyat and the surrounding areas. This area is known as the exclusion zone and is still restricted today, due to the high levels of radiation. One game that does its best to accurately depict the environmental changes of the exclusion zone is Chernobylite. While having fictional elements, the team creating the game conducted 3D imaging of the exclusion zone, allowing players to view the exclusion zone without traveling to Ukraine. This chapter examines how games are being used in academic studies; the history of Chernobyl and the environmental impact of the actual event; the portrayal of Chernobyl in games and media in recent years; and what Chernobylite does differently than its predecessors. By doing so, it is possible to see how Chernobylite has indeed shed a new light in the exclusion zone.",English,75,url,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-67980-3_2,3,non_empirical,2024

Yet the human-destroyed Earth, planetary colonization, and mission to “save the world” from a “season of death” evoke deeply controversial ethical debates about climate (in)action, responsibility, and redemption. By posing real-world ethical dilemmas in another world, the game fulfills some of the best virtues of speculative fiction. Plotlines and dialogue present urgent crises that the game mechanics actively prevent the player from resolving and that are easy to forget in the game’s beautiful aesthetics and strange blend of futuristic and fantastic elements. Player impotence in the face of a weird world marks Harvestella as a video game in the New Weird tradition, although the game eventually subverts the acceptance that characterizes that genre’s response to weirdness and lack of agency. In doing so, the game questions the ethical implications of ambivalence in the Anthropocene and poses difficult questions about the ethics of living in and during a time of catastrophe. Ultimately, Harvestella’s only meaningful decision point, whether to use the genocidal computer Protocol Harvestella, argues for a response to the crisis that is not New Weird ambivalence or Old Weird terror but a resolve to pursue a better future, even if that future is uncertain. In this light, Harvestella is both a climate change and ethical game and a novel example of both.",English,75,url,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-67980-3_15,3,non_empirical,2024

The game’s characterisation of technology, science, and religion has led some commentators to understand Horizon Zero Dawn as presenting a firm rejection of religious narratives in favour of scientific perspectives. However, closer examination of the game’s biblical influences reveals that Horizon Zero Dawn employs religious ideas of the past and present to articulate its vision of a post-apocalyptic future. The integration of biblical material into the story, aesthetics, and gameplay of Horizon Zero Dawn provides multi-layered interactions with specific characters, images, and ideas from the Bible. The game engages with the narrative of David and Goliath, the plague imagery of the Exodus narrative, and New Testament apocalyptic imagery in order to tell a story of ecological collapse, global apocalypse, and technological recreation. Investigation of its biblical influences demonstrates that Horizon Zero Dawn embraces religious narratives insofar as they may be integrated into the game’s discussion of human responsibility, environmental sustainability, and the existential concerns of its post-apocalyptic scenario.",English,169,url,https://jibs.hcommons.org/2022/07/19/dyer-horizon-zero-dawn/,5,non_empirical,2021

This article explores futurity as an effect of response, as an aesthetic experience of playing a narrative video game. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the ways in which video games are engaged in ecocriticism as an aspect of cultural work invested in the future. In the presented reading of the 2017 video game Horizon: Zero Dawn, it is argued that the combination of the affect creating process of play, in combination with a posthumanist and postnatural plot, creates an experience of futurity, which challenges generic notions of linear temporal progress and of the conventional telos of dystopian fiction in a digital medium. The experience of the narrative video game Horizon Zero Dawn is presented as an example of an aesthetic experience that affords futurity as an effect of playing, interlinked with a reflection on the shape of the future in a posthumanist narrative.",English,160,url,https://doi.org/10.3390/h10020072,47,non_empirical,2021

87,Faucher,1,Call Me Corvo: Reading Kinship in Dishonored Through the Lens of Moby-Dick,"This chapter reads Dishonored (Arkane Studios. 2012) through the environmental ethics explored by Ishmael in Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick. Ishmael’s kinship ethic informs a rich engagement with Dishonored, in which opportunities for the player to consider their own moral positionality, and the game’s connections between the objectification of animals and sociopolitical corruption, offer a relevant perspective on our current climate crisis and kinship failures. Dishonored’s totalitarian city setting, Dunwall, fundamentally fails at kinship with non-human animals, despite a player’s best efforts; though Ishmael’s kinship ethic is compatible with the conditions of Dishonored’s “good” ending, it cannot be fully integrated into Dunwall as it exists within the game. The persistent incompatibility of the kinship ethic developed in Moby-Dick with Dunwall’s state of affairs indicates a critique of the societal failure to recognize interdependence between humans and non-human animals. The game’s large-scale societal consequences of kinship failure have implications for our approaches to kinship today; a close textual analysis of Dishonored reveals the crisis of relationship between humans and non-human animals, particularly the need for humans to recognize kinship with non-human animals and the consequences of failing to do so. By examining the commodification of non-human animals in each text alongside game environment responses to player activity, this chapter considers the “environmental” impact of human corruption and suggests philosophical animism as a potential solution.",English,75,url,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-67980-3_14,8,non_empirical,2024

91,Fletcher,1,Gaming conservation: Nature 2.0 confronts nature-deficit disorder,"This article explores the role of digital (video and computer) games in the rise of what Büscher (2014) calls “nature 2.0”: new web-related media that allow users to move beyond passive voyeurism to actively “co-create” or “prosume” the images and processes promoted by organizations committed to biodiversity conservation. Environmentalists have long expressed concern that increasing mediation of human–nonhuman interactions by electronic technology is contributing to a growing “nature-deficit disorder” (NDD) and thereby diminishing support for conservation. This concern would seem to implicate the electronic media comprising nature 2.0 as well, yet digital games are increasingly promoted by environmental organizations precisely for their potential to overcome this very problem. In this paper, I explore to what extent this aspiration is warranted by analyzing digital games devoted to issues of tropical rainforest conservation. In support of proponents’ aspirations and contra the NDD thesis, I suggest that the virtual nature experiences digital games provide may at times actually inspire more affective commitment to environmental causes than the direct experiences most conservationists advocate. On the other hand, as critics of overarching new media assert, engagement with digital games can create a false sense of agency in that belief in the efficacy of one’s virtual engagement may discourage more direct entanglement in the complicated and contentious politics of “real” natural resource management. The result, I propose, is a likelihood that digital games will increase the widely documented “environmental values-behavior gap” between professed commitment to environmental causes and effective action in support of such causes.",English,153,url,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2016.02.009,44,non_empirical,2017

The idea that video games are potential vehicles for “becoming-with-many” is exemplified by discussing Bear Simulator (2016), a video game that promises players that they will experience life through the eyes of a bear. By combining Deleuze and Guattari’s notion of becoming-animal with phenomenological approaches to video game avatars and object-oriented ontology, this chapter suggests that Bear Simulator simultaneously expands and collapses the limits of the human body, allowing players to playfully explore the fusion of the human and non-human. Indeed, Bear Simulator rejects the fetishization of objectives and the telos obsession typical of video games and instead focuses on exploring and nurturing the relationship between the human player and the animal avatars.",English,56,url,https://doi.org/10.4324/9781003049883,32,non_empirical,2020

The “sounds of extraction” and “extractive music” refer to music where compositional and listening practices ambiguously serve as an ecological remedy while also inflicting environmental harm. Grounded in ethnographic approaches to game audio, I sketch out how the sounds of resource use, regeneration, and extraction are encoded in sound and music in the animation of interactive gameplay moments and in cutscenes.

This study demonstrates genre-focused analysis by elevating feature-level analyses of Horizon Zero Dawn.

I bring this conundrum into my discussion of animated and digital representations of nature across children’s screen media. Through my analysis of the films Wolfwalkers and How to Train Your Dragon, along with the popular videogame Minecraft, I propose that the animated, digital, and virtual experiences that constitute so much of children’s screen time today open a space for radical reconfigurations of the human/nature relationship.

To complement her position, in this paper, we aim to inspire game designers and researchers to explore ways in which video games can remodel the perceived player subject as a pathway to ecological entanglement. We investigate four strategies for decentering and deconstructing the subject. These are: (1) deconstructing the subject to foreground internal sources of entanglement; (2) dismantling, distorting, ignoring, and/or invading the visual perspective; (3) conceptual deconstruction and reframing of a sense of self; and (4) decentering the subject through shifting contexts. For each of these, we introduce relevant examples of narrative and gameplay design in existing video games and suggest steps for further development in each direction.",English,152,url,https://doi.org/10.1177/15554120231179261,44,non_empirical,2023

Encounters with animal subjectivity, however, are not. The anthropocentric nature of video games means that animals are often environmental objects, and sometimes resources, but only occasionally characters, and rarely protagonists. As a consequence, there is no encounter with the animal presence, and often no shared gaze: The look of the animal is instead transformed into something wholly antagonistic (such as in Horizon Zero Dawn), wholly submissive (as in Far Cry Primal) or absent entirely (Red Dead Redemption). Even when video game animals are designed with the intention of “appreciating” the animals, the privileging of their panoptic human spectators just as often results in their objectification.",English,200,url,https://doi.org/10.1386/public.30.59.72_1,8,non_empirical,2019

The chapter suggests that ecocritics can benefit not only from metaphorical forms of proceduralism, but also by better understanding literal forms of the ways in which visual rendering technologies themselves figure and unfigure nature/culture divides. Ecocritics often have to read against the grain in a videogame like Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2) for the ways in which a player interacts with the environment procedurally. Long gone in RDR2 are the days of static and largely-pixelated 2D overhead skies and clouds like those seen in the Nintendo Entertainment System console’s Super Mario Bros.

It also identifies game elements that theoretically risk reinforcing false beliefs about climate change, masking its root causes, perpetuating the outdated nature-culture dualism, or feeding a blind faith in technological solutions.",English,94,url,https://dl.digra.org/index.php/dl/article/view/1946,8,non_empirical,2023

141,Lohne,1,Never Alone: A study of articulations of indigenous religion in the video game,"This thesis explores the many ways indigenous religion is articulated, performed and translated in the video game Never Alone - Kisima Inŋitchuŋa (2014). The video game was among the first of its kind – being made in a close collaboration with an indigenous group, and published by the first indigenous owned video game company in the U.S.A. At launch, Never Alone gathered attention from traditional media in both North America and in Europe, and the game reached a global audience. Never Alone tells a story based on Inupiat storytelling, and Cultural Ambassadors gives the player an insight into Inupiat culture and tradition. Never Alone balances on the edge between the conventions of the video game medium and its genres, and of indigenous tradition and religion. This thesis examines how vocabularies that can be related to ‘indigenous religion’ are used and translated by in Never Alone, and how these vocabularies relate to a globalizing discourse on indigenous religion. This thesis also explores how the medium of video games facilitates new ways of reclaiming traditions and articulating indigenous religion.",English,105,url,https://hdl.handle.net/10037/20085,43,non_empirical,2020
123,Jansen,1,The Environment at Play: Confronting Nature in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and the “Frostfall” Ecomod,"In this paper, I argue that the natural environment in the base game of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is devoid of agency and power in the face of the player’s colonialist endeavours to explore, conquer and master that environment. Weaving together insights about spatiality in digital games from (ecocritical and postcolonial) game studies, as well as performance studies, the paper problematizes some of the most basic elements of digital games in general: navigation and movement. It then moves to a discussion of the “Frostfall” mod as one possible option to counteract the destructive and oppositional relationship between the player and nature in Skyrim. “Frostfall” is an ecomod that adds weather survival elements to the game, by which the player can freeze and die from hypothermia if they do not take the appropriate measures to cope with Skyrim’s harsh climate. In this way, the power fantasy set up in the base game becomes somewhat limited, as the player’s agency encounters nature’s newfound agency and must find ways to negotiate the gameworld while taking seriously the environment as an agent in and of that gameworld.",English,196,url,https://press-start.gla.ac.uk/index.php/press-start/article/view/125,44,non_empirical,2019

Moreover, I will illustrate how evolving concepts of the utility of virtual environments can assist ecocritics in branching out both their analyses and dialog with the public. In particular, I will point to how a study of virtual environments as embodying narratives of environmental ethics bridges important gaps in present cultural studies. This is not an essay written primarily for ecocritics, although a basic familiarity with the past aims of literary ecocriticism may aid the reader in acknowledging the importance of technological scholarship. Nor is the subject matter at hand primarily the domain of game theorists: If nothing else, I hope to show that our evolving game worlds and '"second lives'" offer vital spaces for expanding the stories told between academic, designer, and player with regard to our natural world.

Analysis: This article examines Anishinaabe, Métis, and settler-Irish media theorist and artist Elizabeth LaPensée’s video game Thunderbird Strike as a form of Indigenous cultural resistance to extractivism. Conclusion and implications: Thunderbird Strike expresses the necessity of halting the expansion of extractivism by inviting players to participate in the sabotage of unjust infrastructure.

Geralt’s predispositions as a witcher places him in conflict with nature, but his moral code and decisive silence allow for a space in which, though the two occur independently and jointly, the voice of the feminine and the voice of the nonhuman world can be heard on their own terms, instead of through the objective filtering of the hero. Yet, in this space of voices and silence, the natural world remains opposed to the protagonists, which CD Projekt RED elevates to monstrifying the natural in opposition to the player, giving voices to some zoomorphic and anthropomorphic monsters, but leaving other nonhuman ecomorphic creatures without voice, encouraging anthropocentric dominance over the environment.",English,105,url,https://fau.digital.flvc.org/islandora/object/fau%3A95779,3,non_empirical,2022

It further takes on an ecocritical lens using the works of Lawrence Buell and Hans Joachim-Backe to establish various ecocritical criteria to summarize and judge video games by. Then, by analysing four different games, Factorio, Frostpunk, Outer Wilds, and Rainworld using the criteria this thesis establishes these games as having ecocritical value and further discusses how through their mechanics, narratives, visuals, and dialogue are able to introduce ideas of the sublime. Then using this analysis, the thesis aims to argue that these games present narratives and mechanics show that through transhumanist and antihumanist philosophies we as humans can potentially overcome the feeling of the Lovecraftian dynamic sublime and the Lovecraftian mathematical sublime respectively and potentially triumph in the face of the infinite. Finally, by identifying the ways in which these video games present bleak narratives about the future of humanity it argues that perhaps games like them can act as a wake-up call to players as to the dangers of an impending climate catastrophe.",English,105,url,https://hdl.handle.net/1946/48543,34,non_empirical,2024
133,Laato,2,Central Themes of the Pokémon Franchise and why they Appeal to Humans,"Pokémon has become the most profitable cross-media franchise since its creation 25 years ago. In this conceptual work, we go through the current eight generations of Pokémon games, movies and anime episodes to understand why the franchise appeals to humans. We focus on the following four core themes: (1) relationship with the Pokémon creatures; (2) exploration and adventure; (3) social connectedness and acceptance; and (4) green technologies and living in symbiosis with the environment. We discuss how these themes resonate with human primal desires and what aspects of Pokémon transcend into the real world. Our findings indicate that the Pokémon world is able to offer humans aspects of the hunter-gatherer era that are missing from the current urban way of living. The franchise appeals to human primal desires by being about exploring the world, understanding it and finding harmony with other living creatures. Our findings support previous work on the appeal of specific Pokémon games, and contributes to our understanding of what has made the franchise popular.",English,97,url,http://hdl.handle.net/10125/70958,46,non_empirical,2021

135,Lee,1,What Could Be Worse Than Death? Untangling Entangled Existence in The Last of Us (2013),"Recent moves in the environmental humanities and posthumanism have called for expanded considerations of non-anthropocentric conceptions of life and what it means to cohabitate with non-human others. Given its postapocalyptic setting and story, which pivots on a fungal virus that transforms human hosts into fungal/human hybrids, Naughty Dog’s 2013 action-adventure videogame The Last of Us is a text which explicitly explores notions of human/non-human relations narratively, thematically, and aesthetically. Recently, the game has been taken up as offering an image of the possibilities of entangled existence, what Anna Tsing describes as “the possibilities of coexistence within environmental disturbance.” Such a reading holds that The Last of Us offers a positive vision of what non-anthropocentric life could or should look like but is at odds with the game itself. Contrary to this view, this article suggests that The Last of Us argues in favour of an anthropocentric understanding of life and the world, fundamentally reinforcing a worldview in which human beings are uniquely privileged, primarily due to our capacity for self-consciousness, which the game posits as the key difference between the human and the nonhuman other. This article also suggests that a desire to frame the game as a positive vision of posthuman existence is misplaced, and given the popularity of the game both commercially and critically, that it is instead paramount to untangle what the game itself has to say about entangled existence. Ultimately this paper argues that The Last of Us may actually offer a cynical or reactionary view of human/nonhuman relations, an assertion which will be developed and supported through close analysis and discussion of the game and the central role played narratively, thematically, and aesthetically by the figure of the infected, anthropomorphic hosts which carry the fungal virus of the game’s story. While these figures are typically read as no different than standard zombies, the specificity and nuance born out of their status as fungal/human hybrids holds the key to unlocking what The Last of Us ultimately suggests about non-anthropocentric life: that it is perhaps the only thing worse than death.",English,225,url,"https://jps.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/theneutral/article/view/37022#:~:text=While%20these%20figures%20are%20typically,only%20thing%20worse%20than%20death.",8,non_empirical,2024
136,Lehner,1,Videogames as Cultural Ecology: Flower and Shadow of the Colossus,"In this paper, I discuss videogames as a form of cultural ecology using the examples of Flower (2013) and Shadow of the Colossus (2011). As foundation for this thesis I deploy Farca’s “Emancipated Player” as a player-type receptive for representational art and as a form of dialectic meaning-production between an actual player of this type and the implied player (the game’s design). This will be connected to Zapf’s notion of literature as a cultural ecology. Addressing similarities in function and differences in the mediality of literature and videogames and considering recent studies in game-theory and ecocriticism, I will demonstrate that emancipated play of aesthetically complex videogames can be considered a condition for videogames to function as a form of cultural ecology and thus also as a regenerative force in the larger cultural context akin to literature. The exemplary analyses consider especially the use of unnatural anti-conventions as a self-reflexive technique for reflections about videogames themselves, which are connected to reflections about the empirical reality. The games offer perspectives creating blanks for the player to be filled with her imagination and consequently unfold arguments about the aesthetic condition and conventions of videogames as a mirror of a neoliberal society without regard for the environment or the non-human. It becomes clear that representation or procedural rhetoric alone cannot be sufficient to describe the aesthetic effect of the videogame as a Gesamtkunstwerk (an all-embracing art form). They can only function as cultural ecology, if we consider them as multimedia artworks offering a degree of openness for the imaginative power of the player. To play videogames is not either to observe or to inhabit, it is the amalgamation of both which enables their creative force to influence the discourse as cultural ecology.",English,143,url,https://doi.org/10.37536/ECOZONA.2017.8.2.1349,47,non_empirical,2017

Like the nature they inhabit and/or represent, the monstrous-feminine characters in ecohorror video games cannot be controlled. Female monsters that have become hybridized in some way with nature—whether through flora, fauna, fungi, or by contagion which they then spread to others—are central to the ecohorror narrative. Using the games Blair Witch and Resident Evil VII: Biohazard/Resident Evil Village, I investigate how anxieties surrounding both gender and ecology intersect, seeking the ways in which these female characters’ transgression of categories interrogate the artificial dichotomy between humanity and nature. I argue that despite storylines seemingly embedded in ecophobia, it is possible to analyze ecohorror video games as narratives empowering both monstrous-feminine characters and the ecology that spawns them by using a feminist ecoGothic lens.",English,116,url,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/376450396_Uncanny_Monstrous_and_Sublime_ecoGothic_Transformations_in_Horror_Video_Games,3,non_empirical,2023
144,Loring,1,Redefining the Monstrous-Feminine: Applying a Postfeminist (Eco) Gothic Reading to Horror Video Games,"This dissertation examines the connections between the monstrous-feminine and the environment in horror video games while addressing a major gap in ecocritical theory—that of the role video games play in the discourse. While many feminist media scholars have chosen to read the monstrous-feminine through a psychoanalytical lens, I argue that this theory is too limiting and male-centered. Monstrous-feminine characters often work in tandem with the natural world to overthrow the intersecting oppressions of misogyny and environmental degradation caused by heteropatriarchy, colonialism, and capitalism. My project attempts to spark a conversation around these intersections as they occur in horror games and open up ecocriticism to the potential of new media for connecting with the non-academic world. Through a postfeminist ecoGothic analysis of archetypal characters like the witch, the werewolf, the vampire, and the ghost as they appear in the games Blair Witch (2019), Blacktail (2022), Werewolf: The Apocalypse—Heart of the Forest (2020), The Quarry (2022), BloodRayne (2002), Resident Evil Village (2021), Vampyr (2018), Redfall (2023), The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes (2021), Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly (2003), and Fatal Frame V: Maiden of Black Water (2022), I show how these monsters interact with, and often act on behalf of, the environment to challenge patriarchal domination of women and nature.",English,105,url,https://www.proquest.com/openview/23cf040000585715275c77e521eead46/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y,3,non_empirical,2024

But what if play acted as more than just an escape and rather, a tool for change, an instrument for conceptual thinking and creative expression. I believe that importance of play is often overlooked and yet is fundamental to human and non-human condition. Johan Huizinga argues the importance of play in Homo Ludens, observing that play precedes culture, as for however it is defined, culture presupposes human society and notably, animals (amongst other non-humans) have played long before us, supposing that culture is therefore expressed through forms of play. Through this essay I propose how experimentation in play, specifically ‘critical play’, can reconnect us to the non-human, thus promoting interspecies justice as essential to our earthly survival. And as a way of out of the Anthropocene, where we have identified ourselves as the key agents in the climate crisis; our impact on the earth will now leave a permanent scar. Utilising SF thinking: “science fiction, speculative fabulation, string figures, speculative feminism, science fact, so far” outlined by Donna Haraway in Staying with the Trouble and the process of worlding in demonstrating how play in “worlds, gone, here, and yet to come”, can drive a social change and ontological reconfiguration of what has agency when we talk about the environment. I suggest that by building empathy for the non-human through play, we can collectively speculate as to how to induce a return to non-anthropocentric approaches when designing solutions to the climate crisis.",English,105,url,https://hugoloydell.com/the-non-human,5,non_empirical,2022

This reading blends Haraway’s construction of the Chthulucene, a chthonic epoch of inter-species entanglements, with Barbara Creed’s articulation of the “archaic mother” as creation and deadly abyss. This article addresses how zombies, as regenerative, recuperative figures, allow for pathways into the Chthulucene, paying special attention to how particular zombies (those present in the video game The Last of Us) represent the kind of cross-species kin-making that Haraway describes.",English,216,url,https://doi.org/10.1353/sif.2019.0003,3,non_empirical,2019

From a global perspective, the children of the 21st century will inherit the Earth of tomorrow. Some of the most drastic changes and challenges in the world today include environmental protection and climate change. In the case of the Canary Islands, the landscape, flora and fauna are key components of its identity and culture. Video games can be used as educational tools to design teaching proposals aimed at protecting the natural environment and engaging younger generations to get involved in looking after these natural spaces. As he explains [1] the tools of the past to give way to platforms relating to the field of media that must be valued to experiment with new forms of expression applied to the artistic field: '"It is now time to digitalize historical analogies, the transitions between a historical or artistic forms, to finally accomplish the aesthetic revolution operated by the Virtual. The Virtual concretely becomes Neo-ludic, as in a coherent field of new forms of expression, wittingly including all those who are identified as their predecessor'" [1], p. 122. From this idea, the notion of '"artistic video game'" [2] and educational entails notions of aesthetics, of learning through play, of interactivity, of transmedia narrative formats, of postmodern concepts such as simulacrum, simulation, as well as those who use video games for artistic purposes to achieve a goal such as Joan Leandre [3], other authors use video game support to adopt a visual author''s language such as Jon Haddock´s Screenshots [4] which uses scenes from newspapers or images from films transferred to the video game. This research paper provides an explanation of why ecological education based on these notions of art and aesthetics that are linked is essential in the university context, specific examples of ecological videogames that will be used as educational teaching resources, a description of educational video games or serious games as a platform for teaching and learning, a teaching proposal related to ecological video games, and, lastly, the conclusions obtained.",English,90,isbn,978-989-99370-7-9,45,non_empirical,2018

Some videogames approach the issue better than others in terms of videoludic aesthetics. The use of skins with the tag of ecological that we can see in Cities Skylines: Green Cities (Paradox Interactive, 2017) is purely superficial because it does not alter the core gameplay of this genre of videogames, representing the harshest excess of capitalism that is leading humanity to the climatic disaster. There are, however, videogames that employ a truly sustainable aesthetic, both visual and playable; in which we learn about the fictional environment without the need to conquer the space or level up to build on virgin lands.

Through this analysis an understanding is developed of how Death Stranding enlists players in the process of repeating apocalypse(s) and invites reflection upon the place of video games and play in these fractious times.",English,21,url,https://doi.org/10.1386/jgvw_00107_1,59,non_empirical,2024
154,May,2,Dark Entanglement and Visions of the Post-Anthropocene in Battlefield 2042,"While the revelation of our entanglement with other biological actors and our surrounding environments can radically reshape our relations with Earth, a form of dark entanglement also underlies contemporary life. This darkness is legible through the ways that enmeshed capitalist, geotechnic, and cybernetic infrastructures fuel unsustainable and exploitative human interactions with Earth. This form of dark entanglement also underpins the operational logic of the military-industrial complex. We turn to Battlefield 2042 (DICE, 2021), where player encounters with dark entanglements coalesce into a vision of an apocalyptic post-Anthropocene era. Textual analysis of the game reveals how its narrative and ludic structures plunge players into a harrowing vision of Earth’s future. The entangled forces of capital, geotechnic systems, and military-industrial imperatives emerge as central to the play of Battlefield 2042 and situate players at the point of transition from the Anthropocene era to an apocalyptic post-Anthropocene future. Extending arguments that the material conditions of the Anthropocene have permeated digital media, we suggest that games such as Battlefield 2042 reflect, illuminate, and extrapolate the inexorably necrotic logic of our era. Understanding this intricate web of dark entanglements, including through videogames, is crucial for grappling with the existential challenges that define the Anthropocene and what may follow.",English,176,url,https://gamescriticism.org/2024/10/09/may-hall-6a/,59,non_empirical,2024

156,Mckeown,1,"Videogame Ecologies: Interaction, Aesthetics, Affect","This project is driven by omissions at the intersection of ecological game studies and mediaecology. Although authors have studied videogames from a variety of ecological approaches, few have attempted to develop a holistic methodology, embracing videogames'' specific attributes while recognising their role within larger physical systems. This thesis is an attempt to address this, reading videogames as simultaneously about and functioning as ecologies. My methodology draws on the agential-realist philosophy of Karen Barad whose theory of ''intraactivity'' is abundant with ecological ramifications. Adapting Barad''s ''intra-active'' framework for use with contemporary videogames, I read them as assemblages of hardware, software and their human players. I explore three significant aspects of game studies: interaction, aesthetics and affect. Focusing on interaction, I analyse the game Shelter. Emphasising the role of hardware and software, I read these processes in conjunction with an understanding of gameplay. This encourages a shift away from seeing gameplay as ''interaction'' as it is defined within human-computer-interaction, and instead promotes a view that is ''intra-active''. Siding with Barad, play is radically reframed as a phenomenon that produces the apparent objects of its inception. In the second study I approach a series of more experimental games illustrating how an agential-realist worldview influences aesthetics. Analysing high-concept puzzle games Superhot, Antichamber, and Manifold Garden, I suggest that these games place a focus on aspects of ecology often over-shadowed in so-called ''natural'' imaginings of our world, such as time, space and their entanglement. Finally, bringing my focus to the role of the player in my ecological understanding of games I analyse a number of short, human-centred or biographical games. Seeing the role of the player in an ecological manner, designers deviate from traditional methods of generating pathos and affect. Rather than developing empathetic relationships between player and avatar through immersion, viewing the player as only a part of an ecological system demands a posthuman response from players. These designers ask players to empathise while acknowledging their role is small and not central. This thesis presents a novel point of view that draws attention to the ambitious design practices of artists while suggesting new avenues in the future.",English,105,url,https://theses.gla.ac.uk/8878/,5,non_empirical,2018

It argues that the game privileges charismatic megafauna and forwards popular notions about what is considered a desirable animal. By privileging certain species over others, Viva Piñata inadvertently places itself in a conversation about conservation, endangered species and pest management. Recognizably domestic animals (ducks, chickens, etc.) and beautiful, easily recognized animals (lions, tigers) are the symbols of cultural good in the game, while other beasts (bats, moles, wolves) bear the label of ‘pest’ and must be guarded against or destroyed. Furthermore, all of the animals carry a literal monetary value; charismatic megafauna have higher values, just as they do in the cultural imagination. Admittedly, all of the animals within the game are cute creatures, named after the candy that fill them (Fizzlybear, Mousemallow), but Viva Piñata remains a site of cultural hegemony, where popular views about animals are enacted through gameplay. To support these ideas, this article follows the critical work of Chilla Bulbeck and Randy Malamud.",English,21,url,https://doi.org/10.1386/jgvw.7.2.203_1,3,non_empirical,2015

The purpose of these environments is not essentially to separate humans and the natural world. Instead, the environments point to other forms of complex, messy interrelationships that often do not have neat closures and resolutions. In other words these are not just bad relationships between queers and their environments, they are moments and opportunities for critically shifting perspectives, and, in the words of Kadji Amin, “deexceptionalizing” and “deidealizing” the relationship between queerness and nature to better account for the position of queerness in systems of power.20 Within the context of queer games and queer game studies, this means deidealizing the connection between queer characters, stories, players, and their natural environments, refusing to romanticize ourselves as suffering, exiled stewards of the natural world with special access, knowledge, or kinship with it.",English,202,url,https://doi.org/10.16995/regeneration.16506,3,non_empirical,2024

The article argues argue that Never Alone reinterprets the values, experiences, and social structure of traditional Inuit competition for Iñupiaq communities by adapting a traditional story into an online puzzle-platform game. Through an online platform, the game reinterprets the community houses in which games are played into a digital form. This brings Iñupiat self-determination into broader conversation with Inuit interests throughout the Arctic. The paper discusses the relationship between Arctic games and changing definitions of Inuit sovereignty.

This chapter will first provide a background for the emergence of digital gaming alongside the rise of posthumanism as a discipline concerned with the impact of technology on the human, then with the questioning of anthropocentrism and of the nature of humanity itself. After a brief presentation of the greater symbiosis between the human and the machinic in videoludic entertainment, the role of this integration on the gamer’s affect and identification with a virtual avatar will be analyzed, with a focus on the theme of empathy for androids in Detroit: Become Human. The new millennium’s mounting awareness of the Anthropocene has led video games to address our precariousness, and the study will then reflect such an evolution, from the earlier superhero saving the world (traditional games) to a more humble character struggling for their life (survival horror games) or to assert their singularity (LGBT+- and disabled-friendly games), to a responsible citizen aware of their situatedness in the world trying to empathize with the endangered planet (ecocritical and nonhuman, object-oriented games).",English,57,url,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-04958-3_6,23,non_empirical,2022
164,Miner,1,Critical Protocols in Indigenous Gamespace,"This article examines Indigenous video games that critique mainstream environmental politics at the level of mechanics. An analysis of video games’ influences on ecological values requires looking beyond the representational to the mechanical relationships between player and software. As a cultural–computational medium, video games are embedded with ethics of interaction that inflect this representational dimension by requiring that players generate the text as participant. With the recent visibility of Indigenous rights movements, developers have embedded Indigenous cultural protocols in the mechanical interactions (or technical protocols) of gameplay. In the context of critique, their integration produces “critical protocols,” configurations of gamic action that encourage players to evaluate their treatment of real-world environments. Critical protocols emerge between the technical and cultural, where scripts for interaction in algorithmic spaces intervene in affirmative game design and work as an analog beyond the game. Indigenous developers call for new ways of computing and critiquing settler digitality through play. These games aim toward representational as well as computational sovereignty.",English,152,url,https://doi.org/10.1177/15554120211005366,3,non_empirical,2022

Maggie has returned from a hunting trip with a ‘ten point buck’ strapped to the back of her station wagon and is challenged by the town doctor, Joel, a New Yorker who has been sent to the small isolated Alaskan town of Cicely to fulfil a four-year placement obligation.1 Joel’s struggle to fit-in with the lifestyle, customs and traditions of the townspeople forms the main premise of the series, and ‘A Hunting We Will Go’ follows his experiences as he attempts to understand the motivation to hunt. The programme explores some of the established positions within the hunting debate, but in fulfilling the generic conventions of a closed structure and reinstated equilibrium demanded by a comedy drama series narrative, it has to arrive at a negotiated position by the end of the episode. The programme was targeted at an audience who, based on demographic profiles, would have been unlikely to support hunting, and the episode steers a course through the various arguments that continue to inform current debates. Attitudinal surveys on hunting during the 1990s indicated that ‘there is no such thing as a general public.",English,61,url,https://doi.org/10.1057/9780230306240_7,5,non_empirical,2011
167,Moore,1,Auroral Heliotropes of the Anthropocene and Wandering the “Quiet Apocalypse” of The Long Dark (2017),"Focusing on the survival video game The Long Dark, this chapter will read the aurora borealis as a heliotropic representation of the relations between technological development and environmental impact. The Long Dark is a survival-crafting sandbox that strands the player on Great Bear Island in the months following a solar flare that destroyed electronic and telecommunication infrastructures across the planet; the aurorae present throughout the game are the remnants of the disaster. Much has been written about the neoliberal imperatives valued by survival-crafting gameplay parameters, a genre whose ludic frameworks involve the negotiation of investment versus cost in a way that, argues Benjamin Abraham, represents “dynamics of industrial accumulation and life under capitalism” (Abraham, Benjamin. 2018. What is an Ecological Game? Examining Gaming''s Ecological Dynamics and Metaphors through the Survival-Crafting Genre. Trace: A Journal of Writing, Media, and Ecology). Unlike other crafting games, however, the sense of precarity present in The Long Dark forces a thoroughly disempowered player to face urgent questions regarding the effect of neoliberal capitalist hegemony, ecological disaster, and the fragility implicit in the perception of environmental mastery conferred by technology. In order to conceive of this fragility, this chapter will employ the “heliotrope”—the metaphor of “sun and radiation as an invisible yet permeable sign of the Anthropocene” (DeLoughrey, Allegories of the Anthropocene, Duke University Press, Durham, 2019)—to figure the aurora borealis of The Long Dark as an inflection point from which to critique, in the words of philosopher Frédéric Neyrat, the Anthropocene as an epoch where “nature as an independent entity and force has been overtaken by the techno-industrial power of humanity” (Neyrat, Frédéric. 2018. The Unconstructable Earth. Translated by Drew S. Burk. New York: Fordham University Press.). Ultimately, the auroral heliotrope offers a powerful metaphor with which to reckon with the Anthropocene thesis as well as the technologies that both enable it and are enabled by it, while illuminating alternative modes of interacting with nature beyond the affordances of technological infrastructures.",English,75,url,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-67980-3_12,3,non_empirical,2024

169,Morrow,1,Wilderness Ecologies in Red Dead Redemption 2 and Horizon Zero Dawn,"At first glance, Rockstar Games’s Red Dead Redemption 2 and Guerrilla Games’s Horizon Zero Dawn seem diametrically opposed in terms of temporal settings, protagonists, and levels of technology. RDR2 seems to operate as an elegy to a lost time of rugged individualism, open frontier, and a mythologized America while HZD reads more as a postapocalyptic jeremiad which warns us of the possible consequences of an overreliance on technology for military as well as environmental purposes. Despite the narratological disparity, these games both engage ecocritical and environmental concepts in ways that complicate the anti-environmentalism of most mainstream games identified by Alenda Chang. Contextualized within the rich history of green game and ecocritical studies, this essay demonstrates that both games offer players space for a more nuanced and complicated understanding of environmental issues through their exploration of the relationship between civilization, technology, and the frontier as well as the representations of the natural world and the structured and unstructured interactions and relationships with flora and fauna. Acknowledging the realities of the environmental issues which pervade mainstream games as well as regressive understandings of nature, this essay teases out the complexity of the wilderness ecologies of these two games and illustrates how they enable players to reflect on larger environmental issues at play. In this essay, I explore the specific “politics of the wild” that both of these games ludically offer through the roles of Aloy, Arthur, and John. I will begin by thinking of these games in terms of Buell’s ecocritical criteria but expand beyond this scope to explore specific aspects of the wilderness from concepts of frontiers, animals, indigeneity, and N/nature to human (which gets constructed a pseudo-European) intervention in that wilderness in forms such as civilization, exploitation, space, and technology. These representations will also be situated within an examination of the concept of open-world games and interactivity, interrogating what it means to play within these environments and how that play influences the construction of wilderness ecologies in both games. My essay will ultimately outline how these games whether through a postapocalyptic jeremiad or an elegy of the American West offer timely, relevant, and surprisingly similar ecocritical notions for contemporary players.",English,75,url,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-67980-3_11,3,non_empirical,2024

171,Nae,1,Beyond Cultural Identity: A Critique of Horizon: Zero Dawn as an Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Simulator,"The post-apocalyptic game Horizon: Zero Dawn is a role-playing game that simulates the adventures of Aloy, a female protagonist, in a world where human civilization has returned to its premodern stage of development and the world’s fauna has mysteriously become robotic. The cause for this regress into premodernity is revealed by the game’s embedded narrative which explains that life on earth had almost become extinct as a result of a military AI going rogue. Implicit in the game’s embedded narrative is a strong critique of global capitalism that highlights how neoliberal ideas such as corporate governance, deregulation, and automation imperil life on the planet. Despite its critique, gameplay is structured on the very principles that the game’s narrative claims to reject. The world of Horizon: Zero Dawn simulates an entrepreneurial ecosystem in which the player must identify opportunities and manage resources in such a manner as to successfully beat the game. The in-game economy encourages the accumulation of natural resources and features no in-built mechanic to account for the environmental consequences of the playable character’s actions, notwithstanding the environmental critique of the game’s narrative. This article argues that, contrary to its scripted narrative, Horizon: Zero Dawn naturalizes capitalism by means of its procedural rhetoric. I further argue that the overt critique of capitalism diverts the player’s attention from the capitalist principles that support gameplay, thus, paradoxically, consolidating the ideological nature of gameplay. The game’s endorsement of capitalism dovetails with a meritocratic worldview which inflects the game’s approach to cultural identity and diversity.",English,195,url,https://doi.org/10.18662/po/11.3/213,38,non_empirical,2020

The guiding questions are how they create their discourses and what strategies they use for that, distinguishing between representation (or how nature appears) and ecocriticism (or what is said about the relationship between people and their environment), as well as what type of player behaviour they allow and favour.

Death Stranding is an ecodystopian AAA game that presents a metaphysical collapse that has affected human existence, society, and the landscape. Unlike similar ecodystopias, the game offers a way forward through slowness and regenerative play.

This article challenges that notion by contrasting a cultural view of videogames with the dominant mere-technology view. Ecocriticism functions as a prestige language for videogames that permits entrance into what sociologist Pierre Bourdieu calls the field of cultural production. Ecology simultaneously provides metaphors for explaining videogame technology while allowing games to enter ongoing critical and cultural conversations. Humanists interested in but unfamiliar with videogames should therefore start with those with environmentalist themes. This article presents Horizon Zero Dawn (2017) as a case study.

In particular, this article highlights a trope that has become popular in god games recently: the move from map-style interfaces to the use of whole Earth images and models. This trope signals an overt and growing—although as I shall point out, imperfect—engagement with planetarity: an emerging worldview that posits the planet as a world-ecology, one that imbeds both human and nonhuman forces while calling for a renewed attendance to the ethics and aesthetics of relationality. At the same time, this article also notes the perpetuation in Gaia games of generic tropes and conventions like the tech tree and expansionist gameplay. The notion of Anthropocene temporality that this article attempts to theorize helps us to think through the juxtaposition between ecological relationality and a continued desire for expansionism and progress, as both of these play out in videogames.",English,182,url,https://doi.org/10.1163/15685241-12341470,43,non_empirical,2020

Through brief analyses of the videogames Stardew Valley, Graveyard Keeper, The Stillness of the Wind and Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture, this paper thus concludes that the most critically interesting engagement with the pastoral genre in videogames rests in pastoral elegy, especially the dark ecological kind elaborated by Timothy Morton, which overturns the progressivist paradigm by dwelling melancholically in decline, death, and dissolution.",English,139,url,https://doi.org/10.46863/ecocene.51,43,non_empirical,2021

Comprising entirely of code lines, these works directly reflect the creators'' vision. Thus, the development of visual realism in these spaces, under absolute control and supervision, can potentially alter players'' perceptions of nature. The ultimate goal of these spaces, filled with creatures threatening the player''s virtual existence, is for the player to overcome these threats and be elevated as a result. Virtual reality, created with refined nature and hierarchical elements, contrasts sharply with the legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, which portray nature as a chaotic, untamed environment with fantastical elements. Represented not only in literary genres like poetry and novels but also adapted into various forms such as series, films, and video games, the nature and environmental perception conveyed by these legends differ significantly from today''s understanding of nature and the environment. Despite being separated by centuries, Arthurian legends and contemporary digital spaces can be read within Ian Bogost''s concept of '"unit operations.'" Using eco-criticism and object-oriented ontology theories in this study, I comparatively examined King Arthur legends and Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games.

How do they represent heroism and hope? Thediscursive struggle to define key aspects of the Great Recession, suchas austerity, the virtuous ethos for facing precariousness, andrebelliousness, not only occurs in the political arena or information TVprograms but also in the narratives of popular culture andvideogames. This article analyses post-apocalyptic videogamebestsellers released between 2009 and 2017. Three “utopianenclaves” are identified, understood as discursive frames or referentsassociated with heroism and hope within these dystopian worlds: (a)“Post-apocalyptic cowboys,” (b) “Back to nature and do-it-yourself,”and (c) “Community leaders, empathy and rebelliousness.” The articleconcludes that it is important to analyse the representation of these“utopian enclaves” from a critical sociocultural approach.",English,224,url,https://gamestudies.org/1903/articles/perezlatorre,45,non_empirical,2019
192,Piano,1,Greening Vvanderfell. An Ecocritical Retrospective on The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind,"This paper analyzes the popular video game The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind (Bethesda Game Studios, 2002), from an ecocritical retrospective. While it cannot be properly considered an ecogame, nor was it made with explicit ecocritical goals, Morrowind offers insights relevant to the current conversation about game design and sustainability. The study examines the ways in which the game’s narrative, gameplay and design choices make relevant points on environmental issues, such as depiction of flora, human-nature relationship, and landscape relevance. Drawing on the most recent ecocritical theories, this paper argues that Morrowind represents a virtuous example for more sustainable game design. The analysis highlights the potential of commercial and massively distributed video games as a medium for environmental education and awareness-raising, while proposing strategies for integrating ecocritical approaches into game design and development.",English,17,url,https://dl.digra.org/index.php/dl/article/view/2221,6,non_empirical,2024

194,Pinder,1,Monstrous Gatekeepers – Eco-gothic Bodies in Video Games,"As we edge closer to the looming ecological crisis of the Late Anthropocene, the fragility of the structures that insulate the human from the unpredictable violence of nature have become increasingly apparent. Ecophobia, that is, the irrational fear of nature and the non-human ecology, manifests across media. However, very few mediums let you walk through those narratives, choose your own path, and be held responsible for a chain of cause and effect. This chapter deals with the transgressive and abject ecoGothic monsters that stalk video games. Rather than being one of many, they are anomalous and ‘unnatural.’ These video games have the primary ecoGothic feature of the abject or monstrous Gothic body, which is hybridized, mutated, or in some way transgressive of species. This is often expressed through the instability of form and fluidity of species. Some harken back to the degeneration theory of the Victorian era; others engage with 20th-century distrust of difference and the unknowable and still further are symptomatic of human hubris and interference. Despite the apparent malevolent nature of these videoludic monsters, their status as evil is often problematized through their vulnerability to the same vast and unfathomable forces as the player character. From games like Sekiro (FromSoftware 2019) that are structured around punishing boss fights connected through supernatural and ecological crises to puzzle games such as The Return of the Obra Dinn (Lucas Pope, 2018) in which the true monstrosity is gradually revealed, the monsters themselves are also victims. They are rendered monstrous through their trauma and otherness. This may be achieved through monstrous ‘technologies’ such as hybridity, contamination, and unfathomability. Through video game narratology and eco-gothic theory, I will explore the complex connections between ecophobia and the video game monsters that stand between the player and their objective.",English,53,isbn,978-1-64889-862-4,4,non_empirical,2024
195,Pinder,1,Negotiating Anthropocentrism and Ecologies in Cozy Games,"As we sit at the precipice of this planet’s sixth mass extinction event, we need to use every tool at our disposal to advocate for our ecologies. Human self-interest and anthropocentric thinking act as barriers to communicating ecocrisis. Cozy video games can create safe spaces to explore the ecological effects of human actions with the aim of prompting reflection and action on environmental issues. Drawing on ecocritical video game scholarship, the aim of this article is to explore the ways in which environments are represented and interacted with in selected cozy video games. Through an examination of the extractivist colonial processes and narratives of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, in contrast with the complex ecocritical coziness of Terra Nil, this article posits that cozy games have the potential to achieve effective environmental communication. Both Animal Crossing: New Horizons and Terra Nil successfully empower the player to shape their environment but only Terra Nil affords ecological empowerment. By creating a safe space to engage with environments and even ecocrisis, cozy games allow players the agency to construct their own econarratives and may challenge or perpetuate anthropocentric ideas about the environment.",English,203,url,https://doi.org/10.18778/2391-8551.11.09,4,non_empirical,2024

As the popularity and immersive capability of digital gaming continues to expand, there is need for investigations of how digital games may either perpetuate ecologically destructive ideologies, practices, and identities or promote and cultivate more ecologically sustainable options. The simulation game genre is of particular interest as these games are typically designed to reproduce and reflect real world activities in which gamers complete tasks for purposes such as education, training, and entertainment. Although elements of the Animal Crossing: New Leaf game may be viewed as promoting sustainable ecological action and fostering identities and practices supportive of ecological wellbeing and sustainability, game features and operations central to play within the constructed game world reflect, normalize, reproduce, and perpetuate the production and performance of identities and human-nature relationships at the root of the ecological crisis.",English,134,url,https://doi.org/10.1080/17405904.2019.1617177,3,non_empirical,2020

Le premier déploie ce que j''ai nommé la nature-décor, retraçant une rapide réflexion sur la question du paysage, la nature-artefact de Descartes, le naturalisme occidental selon les catégories de Philippe Descola qui sépare nature et culture, et enfin sur le transhumanisme comme courant contemporain qui perpétue cette tradition réflexive d''une humanité qui doit s''extraire de la nature. Le deuxième axe s''attache à développer ce que j''ai nommé la nature-matériau, abordant ainsi l''histoire de la domination de la nature par l''homme, notamment suite aux lectures de la Bible et de la fameuse injonction cartésienne d''être comme possesseur et maître de la nature , pour amener ensuite à une lecture critique des projets de géo-ingénierie qui ont la faveur des politiques actuelles. Le troisième axe a pour but d''aborder l''hypothèse Gaïa et la notion d''Anthropocène, en montrant que ces deux théories ont bouleversé les manières de penser la nature et notre relation avec elle mais qu''un véritable climato-scepticisme s''est installé, ayant pour objectif de dénigrer les résultats scientifiques et de propager le doute au sein des populations. Cette propagation du doute servant les intérêts du capitalisme qui est au centre du quatrième axe, qui a pour rôle de soulever les différents conflits politiques et esthétiques en jeu dans ces questionnements mêlant environnement et jeu vidéo. Après une critique de la notion de globe et une mise en lumière des processus capitalistes qui sous-tendent le monde, notamment dans sa manière de tout transformer en valeur marchande, même la pauvreté et les catastrophes climatiques, il sera question de l''esthétique politique du jeu vidéo, de sa capacité à véhiculer des messages idéologiques, ainsi que du rôle de la virtualité dans ces problématiques.",French,105,url,https://dumas.ccsd.cnrs.fr/dumas-01432565,40,non_empirical,2016

Through this, the Slowness in the game can be identified. It will subsequently be argued that this Slowness is the result of Shinto presence in the game, as the tradition is largely concerned with the natural environment and mindfulness, contrasting with the values promoted by capitalism and globalisation.

Through close readings of Proteus (Twisted Tree, 2013) and Islands: Non-Places (Ice Water Games, 2016), this essay argues that certain video games articulate empathetic relationships between player and world, because of—rather than despite—the video game’s position as a virtual realm. Because these two games limit player interaction and manipulate experiences of time, Proteus and Islands: Non-Places force the player to critically inhabit her position in the world and to question her expectations of dominance and control as typically experienced in video games. Applications of material ecocriticism drive the readings of these video games. Specifically, by considering theories of time—both Anna Tsing’s pace of walking and Rob Nixon’s slow time of environmental disaster—together with Jane Bennett’s concept of vibrant matter and Serenella Iovino and Serpil Oppermann’s definition of material ecocriticism, this essay argues that the worlds of Proteus and Islands: Non-Places demand an environmental attention from the player. These two games reject the human desire to touch, cultivate, and master the environment, offering, instead, a digital assemblage that includes the corporeal player and the virtual world. Proteus and Islands: Non-Places, human-made constructions designed for human consumption, drive an investment in the vibrancy of the world—both within the game and without.",English,143,url,https://doi.org/10.37536/ECOZONA.2017.8.2.1351,3,non_empirical,2017

206,Ruffino,1,"Videogames, the Anthropocene, and Other Problems of Scale: Methodological Notes for the Study of Digital Games in Times of Ecological Crisis","In this article I critique and evaluate a number of methodological approaches to the study of videogames and their relationship to the Anthropocene. I identify two dominant tendencies. Firstly, videogames are seen as tools that can potentially inform and educate their players about humanity’s impact on our planet, and possibly suggest virtuous behaviours. Secondly, videogames are analysed for their strategies of representing the Anthropocene, for example, for the ways in which they depict the natural environment or imagine a post-human world. I call these the ‘instrumental’ and ‘representational’ approaches. Both methods of research and game design are valid and useful in many ways, and both rely on their scalability: through repeated engagement with videogames that draw on the instrumental and/or representational approach, players’ reflections on their experience are argued to scale up and influence future behaviour and thinking in real life. I suggest that, in parallel with these methods of critique and design, we can consider the possibility that the Anthropocene is transpiring and leaking into our entertainment practices, becoming visible through molecular and situated encounters. Players might occasionally articulate their fears and anxieties about the ‘Age of Man’ while responding to videogames that are not explicitly about the Anthropocene. This article argues that the scalability of players’ interpretations can be re-evaluated in all its complexity and unpredictability when exploring the potential of the medium of videogames to open up a post-anthropocentric imagination. This article considers a number of examples from game design, drawing on Timothy Morton’s notions of hyperobjects and subscendence, and Joanna Zylinska’s and Anna Tsing’s reassessment of the notion of scale.",English,176,url,https://gamescriticism.org/2024/10/27/ruffino-6-a/,5,non_empirical,2024

The games industry is expanding rapidly, and games are developing in sophistication and complexity. Games (and gaming approaches to other activities) are increasingly being used for serious or social purposes in a wide range of fields, including biodiversity conservation. This paper evaluates the potential of “conservation games” (digital games that promote conservation). It explores ways in which conservation might make use of digital games in the areas of (1) education and behavior change, (2) fundraising, and (3) research, monitoring, and planning. It discusses the risk that games may distract gamers from the real world and its problems or provide misleadingly simple narratives about conservation issues. We conclude that there is great potential for conservation to take more advantage of digital games, provided that conservation games are developed in collaboration with game design specialists, have specific rather than general aims, target a specific and conservation-relevant audience, and (above all) are fun to play.",English,24,url,https://doi.org/10.1111/conl.12113,5,non_empirical,2015

211,Sawers,1,All the animals are gone? The politics of contemporary hunter arcade games,"Recent proliferation and popularity of personal computer and console games has meant that scholarship around video arcade games has been largely ignored. Arcade games had their halcyon days during the 1970s and 1980s when ‘Space Invaders’, ‘Pong’ and ‘Donkey Kong’ were household names. The inception of scholarship into games occurred in the 1990s; a time when arcade games were writ small in the cultural imagination, at least compared to the newer home computer and video games. Thus in games theory they are typically discussed only in terms of their role as antecedents to their more popular kin. Moreover, they seem innocuous because they are so publicly accessible. Against this assumption, and lack of scholarship, this paper explores a selection of contemporary arcade games which we describe as ‘hunting’ games. Arcade hunting games are first-person shooter (FPS) involving one or more players shooting simulated wild animals. They are commonly situated in cinema foyers, hotels, and family entertainment centres. However, despite a presumption of institutional moderation afforded by the public accessibility of these spaces, this paper argues that this genre works through a range of political modalities that require more scholarly consideration than currently given.",English,132,url,https://doi.org/10.1080/10304310903548654,4,non_empirical,2010

Re-contextualising anxiously mixed reception of this videogame’s murderous depths, I follow Haraway’s imperative to ‘stay with the trouble’ (2016:2), tracing ontological involvement between humans, fungal zombies and background assets that question both parasitism and human significance. In the first half, I focus on radical negativity surrounding Ellie’s character before following troubling affects into the second half in order to bridge the interpersonal and interspecies in the aesthetics of the backdrop which shadows the player. Connecting Nonhuman Studies approaches (Tsing 2015; Haraway, 2016; Keetley 2016; Sheldrake 2020) to a basis in Affect Theory (Ngai 2005; Berlant 2011), I utilise textual analysis to unpack player-character struggles with meaningful death in the context of ‘hypermarginal life’: rooted fungi, lichen and plants which live and die beyond even the horizon of our sympathies for the animal world.",English,205,url,https://www.revenantjournal.com/contents/ugly-death-rotting-with-the-more-than-human-in-the-last-of-us-part-ii-2020/,5,non_empirical,2022
215,Seller,1,"Boring Lizards: Ludic Management, Affect and Ambivalence","This chapter utilises Game Studies, Animal Studies and Affect Studies approaches to explore how videogame adaptation Jurassic World: Evolution (Frontier 2018) mediates Jurassic World’s (2015) themes of captivity, anxiety and boredom in a time of routinised risk and perpetual crisis management (Bhattacharyya 2015; Beck 1992). Critically, the game has been denigrated as boring and repetitious (Stapleton 2018; Freeman 2018); dinosaurs sleep more than fight; and players balance variables to meet minimum thresholds of dinosaur contentment and their own enjoyment. If the film’s hybrid dinosaur signals the increasing banality of ‘terrible lizards,’ I argue that Evolution explores boredom systemically through simulations of banal park maintenance where the speculative animal might ‘respond’ to the player through shared affects and constraints. As W.J.T. Mitchell asks of the dinosaur’s ambivalent meanings of power and extinction, “Are we to scream or to yawn?” (1998:69). This is not a break with games of exploitation and manipulation of the animal, but rather an articulation of our complicity and enmeshment in loops of captivity that embrace human and animal but neither completely. Unable to see the animal itself, filled with tantalising contradictions and distance, we instead become-bored-with the animal.",English,129,url,https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2280-9481/16801,5,non_empirical,2023

While Alenda Chang critiques the functionally inert plants of predominantly visual video game environments, this risks reinforcing the treatment of plants in purely instrumental “functional” terms and repeating what Michael Marder identifies as Western marginalization of flora’s rooted, headless alterity, and reifying narrow anthropocentric values of agency and centrality. Indeed, passivity is key to video games, and game studies regrettably marginalize visuality. I propose that questionably “visual” and “inert” background assets (exemplified by grass) offer rich and underexamined terrain for analysis wherein the “plantscapes” dwarfing humanity might challenge disciplinary understanding of agency/interactivity and foreground/background.",English,16,url,https://doi.org/10.2307/jj.10819591.19,5,non_empirical,2024
217,Sellers,1,Pixelated Frontiers: Videogames and the Sublimation of Nature,"Continuing a legacy begun with cyberspace’s metaphorical alignment with explorable “frontiers,” videogames (re)mediate environmental aesthetics and spatial experience. To examine this phenomenon, this thesis begins dissecting the trope of ecological recovery. This structuring logic redeploys Cartesian dualism and purity politics while addressing the player’s desire to enact a meaningful connection with “nature.” The subsequent analysis builds from this tension between the game’s structuring logics, which endorse violent rhetorics of mastery and control, and the player’s affective attachment to “greenness” as such. Chapter 1 defines the aesthetics of open world game design to unwind the ethical orientations this design model both inhibits and facilitates. This unwinding characterizes open world as a design practice that articulates unbounded freedom while occluding its own limitations. While the logic of open world instrumentalizes player exploration, this chapter positions the ambiguous practices of slow wandering as defiant of the violent consumption of space. To further untangle how games organize player desire and organize the player’s experience of space, Chapter 2 describes developments of map designs in the Legend of Zelda franchise as a case study. These maps enforce the system’s strategic practices, interpellating the player as romantic explorer, master of landscapes, and colonialist. Chapter 3 develops a system of categorization for understanding how nonhuman animals signify and function in games and how they determine player orientations. Together, these interrogations concentrate on specific aspects of the game experience to demonstrate how games not only train players in certain subjectivities but also translate player desires to the screen. Digital games, as the defining medium of our time, sublimate the desires that the contemporary consumer subject holds toward environments. The study of these games and their environmental aesthetics allows us to interrogate these desires and their relationship to the structuring logics of this moment in contemporary capitalism.",English,105,url,http://hdl.handle.net/10822/1054938,3,non_empirical,2019

To answer this question from the perspective of visual media studies, I analyze narrative and expressive means used for positive representation of underwater experiences in several examples of screen media. My examples are principally different by origin and yet united by their highly enjoyable effect of immersion into underwater worlds. My primary focus is on Amphibian Man (1928), a cult early science fiction novel by Alexandr Belyaev adapted for screen in 1962 in the USSR.I also explore its unintentionally close contemporary reproduction in The Shape of Water (2016), which even led to accusations in plagiarism. The third example is a contemporary independent video game ABZU by Giant Squid (2016), which replays the same theme of amphibian human existence in a positive light. These cases present a surprisingly rare view of a safe, friendly and interactive marine world, approached by the protagonist who can breathe underwater. I apply the posthumanist lens to find out that, surprisingly, aquatic cyborgs seem to be underrated by the queer thought (Haraway, 2015, 2016); I conclude that the model of ‘queer ecologies’ may become the needed development.",English,133,url,https://doi.org/10.46539/cmj.v2i2.41,46,non_empirical,2021

I argue that these representations of animals are an example of petishizationPetishism includes overidentifying with an animal, an emphasis on dominance over animals and over-representing of certain traits of animals. I trace these qualities of petishism across three other popular forms of interactive media that have the same goal of facilitating care (Tamagotchi, Pokémon and Zoo Tycoon) to discuss the ways in which Safari Central replicates earlier designs. I argue that to better facilitate care between people and animals, designers of interactive media should consider alternate conceptions of care and use Julie Smith’s (2003) theory of performance ethics. Performance ethics understands animals’ performances as communicative transactions and positions humans as listeners. I conclude by proposing alternate designs that incorporate performance ethics and alternate conceptions of care into interactive media.",English,175,url,https://doi.org/10.1386/jem_00065_1,3,non_empirical,2021

225,Smith,1,"Resources, Scenarios, Agency: Environmental Computer Games","In this paper I argue that computer games have the potential to offer spaces for ecological reflection, critique, and engagement. However, in many computer games, elements of the games’ procedural rhetoric limit this potential. In his account of American foundation narratives, environmental historian David Nye notes that the ‘second-creation’ narratives that he identifies “retain widespread attention [...] children play computer games such as Sim City, which invite them to create new communities from scratch in an empty virtual landscape…a malleable, empty space implicitly organized by a grid” (Nye, 2003). I begin by showing how grid-based resource management games encode a set of narratives in which nature is the location of resources to be extracted and used. I then examine the climate change game Fate of the World (2011), drawing it into comparison with game-like online policy tools such as the UK Department for Energy and Climate Change’s 2050 Calculator, and models such as the environmental scenario generation tool Foreseer. I argue that while both may be narrowly successful in generating engagement with climate change and resource issues, in other ways their effect may be disempowering: firstly, they emphasise the scale and complexity of environmental problems; secondly, they prioritise technocratic top-down policy responses at the expense of changes on the level of individual behaviour. This paper then turns to examples of digital games and playing strategies that offer more plural and open-ended engagement with environmental concerns. The on/off-line game World Without Oil (2007) encouraged players to respond to a fictional oil crisis, generating sustained and solution-focussed engagement. David O’Reilly’s off-beat game-animation Mountain (2014), which in its unflinching mountain removes the agency of the player and mocks the ‘nature as resource’ model of games, invites an ontological reconsideration of the player’s relationship with the non-human. Finally, examples of modding and ‘expansive play’ are examined to reveal surprisingly ecocritical playing strategies in the sandbox-game Minecraft, a game that initially seems to take the logic of resource extraction to its extreme.",English,143,url,https://doi.org/10.37536/ECOZONA.2017.8.2.1365,5,non_empirical,2017
226,Smith,1,Commentary: Colonialist Values in Animal Crossing and Their Implications for Conservation,"In the Nintendo game Animal Crossing: New Horizons, players move to an uninhabited island and quickly become instrumental to the naming, aesthetic development, and biodiversity of the island. In some ways, the game can foster a love for and curiosity about nature. In other ways, the game reinforces harmful colonialist values and attitudes that are ultimately an obstacle to conservation in the real world. Here I critique the game values relevant to conservation, both the values that benefit and the values that hinder conservation. I discuss possibilities for a future version of the game that reinforces values better aligned with conservation.",English,155,url,https://doi.org/10.54175/hsustain1030010,3,non_empirical,2022
227,Stokes,1,Ecological Precarity and Techno-Utopianism in the Soundscapes of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,"Analysis of the gameplay, aesthetics, and soundscapes of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild reveals two broad structural principles: ecological precarity (a sense that the natural world is precious, delicate, and vulnerable) and techno-utopianism (a belief that technological progress and human ingenuity can solve every possible problem). Stokes argues that these principles are incompatible—that precarity of the overworld soundscape, marked by ambient nature sounds and delicately atomized piano fragments, is fundamentally at odds with the techno-utopianism of the shrine soundscape, marked by booming machinery and pulsing electronic music. This pivots into a broader discussion of the ways that encoded value systems inform the games that we play. Does the persistent thread of techno-utopianism (alongside the inherent triumphalism of the Zelda franchise''s gameplay), undercut the ecological and aesthetic moral aimed at by the Breath of the Wild ’s designers?",English,54,url,https://doi.org/10.4324/9781003275305,,non_empirical,2024

The positive effects of such role swaps are well-documented in contexts such as combating racial or ethnic biases. Our work expands this research direction by considering animal avatars: We hypothesize that playing as an animal can improve our attitude towards wildlife and nature. In particular, this manuscript contributes a first systematic study on the effects of animal avatars on players’ implicit attitudes towards animals. Our study (N = 78) employs two commercial games featuring different animal avatars, Endling - Extinction is Forever and Bee Simulator, and compares the results of implicit association tests administered before and after gameplay. Our findings confirm significant positive effects of the games on players’ implicit associations with foxes and bees.

229,Swanstrom,1,"Animal, Vegetable, Digital: Experiments in New Media Aesthetics and Environmental Poetics","An audacious, interdisciplinary study that combines the burgeoning fields of digital aesthetics and eco-criticism. In Animal, Vegetable, Digital, Elizabeth Swanstrom makes a confident and spirited argument for the use of digital art in support of ameliorating human engagement with the environment and suggests a four-part framework for analyzing and discussing such applications. Through close readings of a panoply of texts, artworks, and cultural artifacts, Swanstrom demonstrates that the division popular culture has for decades observed between nature and technology is artificial. Not only is digital technology not necessarily a brick in the road to a dystopian future of environmental disaster, but digital art forms can be a revivifying bridge that returns people to a more immediate relationship to nature as well as their own embodied selves. To analyze and understand the intersection of digital art and nature, Animal, Vegetable, Digital explores four aesthetic techniques: coding, collapsing, corresponding, and conserving. “Coding” denotes the way artists use operational computer code to blur distinctions between the reader and text, and, hence, the world. Inviting a fluid conception of the boundary between human and technology, “collapsing” voids simplistic assumptions about the human body’s innate perimeter. The process of translation between natural and human-readable signs that enables communication is described as “corresponding.” “Conserving” is the application of digital art by artists to democratize large- and small-scale preservation efforts. A fascinating synthesis of literary criticism, communications and journalism, science and technology, and rhetoric that draws on such disparate phenomena as simulated environments, video games, and popular culture, Animal, Vegetable, Digital posits that partnerships between digital aesthetics and environmental criticism are possible that reconnect humankind to nature and reaffirm its kinship with other living and nonliving things.",English,32,isbn,978-0-8173-8929-1,,non_empirical,2016

Earth jurisprudents argue that law bears a large part of the responsibility for humanity’s exploitation of the environment, as law helps to bar nature from subjectivity. However, as Žižek warns—and as FFVII illustrates—the desire for meaning incites people to manufacture a harmonious vision of nature that obscures the chaotic forces at work in the environment and ultimately absolves humanity of responsibility towards the world. Therefore, earth jurisprudence’s program of using legal rights to limit human intervention should be rejected in favour of an approach that enables people to take an active role in addressing the ecological crisis.",English,163,url,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11196-016-9497-2,4,non_empirical,2017

That is, in order to win the game, players must play or perform in an ecologically friendly manner, working within and alongside systems that model parts of our real-world environments. I also explore the role of genre in orienting these games towards specific perspectives on the environment, suggesting that each game informs our perspective on the environment without necessarily invalidating or causing obsolescence in the other.

239,van As,1,Environmental ethics in video games: How video games Equilinox and Everything embody the transition from an anthropocentric to an ecological worldview,"The climate crisis is an increasing problem, and in 2021 the Dutch government promised 35 billion euros over the next ten years to fight it. To, at least partly, solve the climate crisis, scholars argue that humans need to abandon an anthropocentric worldview where humans dominate the natural world. A good place to make people adopt, or at least make them think about, new ways of seeing the relationship between humans and non-humans is through mainstream media since it is the primary site for constructing meanings about the environment. A medium that could especially help the rhetoric of green media is that of video games. Video games can contribute to an understanding of and instruction in ecological issues and in shaping environmental or ecological awareness as they are active (the player must actively do things) and interactive (once the player has made choices, the game is now developed in a way that sets certain parameters that affect future gameplay). In this thesis the games Equilinox and Everything are analysed to understand how they represent the transition from an anthropocentric to an ecological worldview. Using utilitarian environmental ethics and deep ecology and Flanagan and Nissenbaum’s model for values in games the two games were systematically researched. This thesis found that the transition from anthropocentric to ecological is not a monotonous transition, but that it can be represented in different ways. Resulting from this research are two of those forms, an active way where players create nature to understand the interconnectedness of different species and their environment, and a passive way where players explore nature to understand the interconnectedness. Concludingly, one cannot speak of the transition from anthropocentric to ecological since this transition can take different shapes or forms.",English,105,url,https://studenttheses.uu.nl/handle/20.500.12932/41551?show=full,44,non_empirical,2022

It focuses on what acts of violence are made possible in games, and against whom. It argues that shifting the critical perspective from killing to killability allows us to study the implicit violence found in ‘‘nonviolent’’ or ‘‘friendly’’ games that usually garner little controversy. Two games that both set out to avoid animal violence, and even promote animal care, are studied: Maxis’ The Sims 3: Pets (2011) and ConcernedApe’s Stardew Valley (2016). The study considers how these games construct a hierarchy of classes of animals that are either included in, or excluded from, the realm of moral concern. Thus, the games are seen as models of how similar hierarchies are created in the real world of so-called ‘‘meat culture’’. Most significantly, the study demonstrates how fish is a prime example of a class of animals that is removed from the realm of moral concern, even in supposedly ethical and animalfriendly games.",English,221,url,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40869-018-0055-x,42,non_empirical,2018

Through close-textual analysis of films The Road (John Hillcoat 2009) and WALL-E (Andrew Stanton, 2008), and videogame The Last of Us (2013), this paper seeks to analyze post-apocalypse representations on screen to raise questions about environmental morality in mainstream culture and ecocritical thinking. The central argument of this paper is that post-apocalypse narratives are manifestations of the public anxiety about environmental catastrophes, which reflect cultural fears.

244,Ventomäki,1,Representation of nature in Red Dead Redemption 2,"This master’s thesis analyses nature representation in Rockstar Games’ video game Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018) by examining the game’s various features, ranging from spatial narratives, game mechanics to its themes. The theoretical foundation of this thesis is based on previous research on nature representation in video games, and the themes of Westerns. The analysis is illustrated with the use of screenshots taken to support the arguments made. The findings of this thesis show how Red Dead Redemption 2 depicts nature and civilization as separate entities, the latter seeking to overcome the former via industrialization and the modernization of society, thus paralleling historical developments in the late 19th century United States. Cities are then antithesis of nature both in terms of space and values. Nature is associated with respite, freedom, frontier spirit and survival while industrialized areas are restrictive, hectic, inhospitable, and polluted. These associations can be seen for example in how non-playable characters engage in deeper conversations, bonding emotionally when traversing nature with the protagonist Arthur Morgan. In these contexts, nature functions as a safe space. The features associated with nature and civilization draw from the themes present in the genre of Westerns, which possess a nostalgic and wistful remembrance of the Old West. The narratives of the Old West – rugged survival, impactful nature, and the man vs. nature narrative – are found in Red Dead Redemption 2 as well. Hunting and survival are at the core of the play experience. Legendary animals roam the wilderness and can be hunted down for unique rewards, something akin to exploitation of nature. However, Red Dead Redemption 2 highlights the importance of nature conservation, for instance through the native American character Charles Smith with whom Arthur Morgan confronts two poachers send to kill a herd of bison. In the end, it is the player’s own decision how they want to approach hunting.",English,105,url,https://oulurepo.oulu.fi/handle/10024/21068,46,non_empirical,2022

What effects does the game have on the players’ behaviour as well as on their interaction with their environment? To answer these and other questions, 89 players were interviewed. Furthermore, a separate field report was prepared regarding the players’ experiences. It was shown that players of Pokémon GO have completely different demands on the landscape than other players. The frequency of AR technology use was also queried.

245,Wallin,1,Game Preserves: Digital Animals at the Brink of the Post-Anthropocene,"As we enter what scientists are calling the 6th mass extinction of life on this planet, we are forced to confront the prospect of a future world without animals. Despite the disappearance of ‘real’ animals in the wake of global ecocatastrophe however, animals proliferate in the ‘Anthropocene’ imaginary, and in particular, through contemporary video games as they reimagine the future relationship of humans and animal life increasingly withdrawn from the lives of humans. The animal imagined in video games herein serves not only to re-join the animal to a culture that has no more room for nature, but to preserve the animal as a sign of our status and significance on a rapidly changing planet. Herein, the surgical remaking of animals within video games constitutes an augury on the future status of the animal and the preservation of its existence via simulation, where it is yet made to labor in the psychical models of liberalism and humanism intimate to the conceits of Anthropocene thinking. Drawing largely from the scholarship of Jean Baudrillard (1994) and his developments on the transmutation of animals from ontological equal to hyperreal companion, this essay will analyze a number of contemporary video games (e.g. Fallout, the Outer Worlds) in which hyperreal animal companions are prominently featured. Following, the essay will aim to articulate the hyperreal reformatting of animality as both an index of our contemporary relationship with non-humans and as a mode of responding to the threat of extinction in the Anthropocene era.",English,154,url,https://doi.org/10.1080/14688417.2021.2023607,8,non_empirical,2022

This thesis asks readers to confront the fact that videogame environments may shape everyday perceptions of real world nature in both positive and problematic ways. By combining a range of contemporary voices in the disciplines of videogame studies (Huizinga, Castronova, Juul, Murray, Lehndonirta, Aarseth, Shaw, and McGonigal) and literacy studies (Gee, Hawisher, Selfe, and Ong), I offer the start of a videogame ecocriticism by focusing on Minecraft (2011) gameworlds and the environmental perspective that they privilege. In particular, I draw on Ian Bogost'"s concept of unit operations and unit analysis to identify characteristics of the gameworld—such as the texture and interactive properties of the dirt block—that might strongly interact with player ideologies about nature. I argue that the privileged position of player over gameworld evident in Minecraft represents a dominant contemporary understanding of nature as existing mostly to support human activities. With at least ten million players and millions of non-players who learn about the game through association, Minecraft is likely to influence ideologies about humanity'"s relationship to nature through its gameplay mechanics and environmental representations. Minecraft gameworlds also complicate an emerging sense of nature at a moment when children and adults may spend more time exploring virtual environments than natural environments.",English,105,url,https://www.proquest.com/openview/546c77f76f921384bf43bc0a7d64d944/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750,3,non_empirical,2013

As is well known, the increasing phenomenon of global warming has led to climate change, which negatively affects all aspects of human life. As a response to these global threats, in 2015, world leaders agreed on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Video games have become effective learning tools in a variety of educational contexts.The use of games in education, known as game-based learning, leverages the engaging and interactive nature of games to enhance the educational experience. Documentary films about video games can be used to teach different aspects of sustainability and climate change in an interactive and fun way. The method employed in this research is the Multimedia Development Life Cycle (MDLC). This method was selected and utilized in the design process of the documentary video film because it involves multimedia elements such as text, images, videos, and animations, making it suitable for processing using this approach. The video provided allows people to develop their understanding deeper from various learning resources. When people provided various resources, especially students, they are able to enrich their understanding. However, ongoing research into the long-term impacts of multimedia on learning outcomes is crucial. Understanding how multimedia influences attitudes and behaviors over time can inform future educational strategies and game designs.

Playing as the lone survivor of the world, Lutum, we unlock different endings through our exchange with the titular Raven. Depending on the navigation through the game, I argue Lutum either demonstrates an anthropocentric disregard for the Raven, or a posthumanist ethic of viewing the Raven as an equal, and even a friend. I explore how the game echoes either humanist or posthumanist ideologies. On the one hand, morality tales are often centred around ideas of individuality, responsibility, choice, and self-reflection. These all align with humanist ideals of the ‘rational self’, rather than questioning wider structures, environments and affects. However, there are still examples in the game of how the different endings suggest right and wrong ways to act that move beyond the human. Drawing on wider discourses around humanistic, Kantian understandings of morality versus posthumanist ethics, I consider how ‘the good ending’ offers a potential for an ethico-onto-epistemological way of being. Through my analysis I therefore demonstrate that the gameplay offers a range of perspectives on the response-ability of humans when confronted with post-apocalyptic scenarios, with the labelled endings suggesting lessons for a post-anthropocentric future. I also explore how material meaning-making occurs through the intra-action between player and game, allowing different material configurations of the world to emerge.",English,176,url,https://gamescriticism.org/2024/10/09/wilde-6a/,5,non_empirical,2024

The game’s protagonist, Aloy, must fight increasingly aggressive machines made in the image of earth’s megafauna as well as the narrow-minded societies of the new earth. Her quest is both a journey of personal discovery and for the betterment of her community, and coupled with her role as a female video game protagonist—which are few and far between—she represents both gender progress and ecological thinking, making her, I argue, an ecofeminist protagonist. Game reviewers, players, and critics have also praised Horizon Zero Dawn for its beautiful graphics, which depict the American West and Southwest. Significantly for an environmental reading, the plot involves scientists creating an AI to terraform Earth’s destroyed environments: the AI is named GAIA, invoking James Lovelock’s Gaia Theory, and thus the game pits nature against technology at the same time that it figures the two as deeply intertwined and presents players with another female figure to consider in relation to ecological themes. This video essay discusses whether Horizon Zero Dawn depicts the world as it “should” be in terms of either gender or ecology, according to ecofeminist theories, and whether Aloy represents an intersectional character according to theorists Patricia Hill Collins and Sirma Bilge. If so, this game could be interpreted as activist in more than just a feminist way. The game’s message of maintaining hope through personal and cultural hardship through strategies both violence-based and based in ethics of care—for others regardless of ethnicity, for the environment—is much-needed in these precarious political times.",English,227,url,http://tracejournal.net/trace-issues/issue2/02-Woolbright.html,3,non_empirical,2018

259,Youngblood,1,The Endless End of the World: Queering the Eco-Apocalyptic Narrative of Final Fantasy VI,"This paper focuses upon developing a queer ecological reading of 1994’s Final Fantasy VI (FFVI), particularly in how the title establishes a central trope of the long-running roleplaying series in positioning a singular queerly resonant villain at the heart of a conflict that poses a direct threat to the “natural” world. FFVI positions ecological crisis as the fault of a specific individual: Kefka, a sociopathic court jester who fits the model of what queer theorist Lee Edelman deems the “sinthomosexual” and seeks to destroy the vision of a life-giving, child-centric future represented by the player’s band of plucky adventurers. The game’s narrative and gameplay mechanics literally divide the gameworld into a “before” and “after” of environmental devastation wrought by Kefka specifically—and its ending suggests the “before” can be easily and instantly restored by the player’s engagement in a systemic loop of consumption and battle, along with a narrative adherence to family, friends, and the hope of the heteronormative. I counter this narrative by drawing upon writers like Timothy Morton and Jane Bennett, who suggest a vision of ecological thought not marked by a return to some impossibly pure “origin” of nature via whatever means necessary, but a more complex mesh of matter, pollution, and debris that we learn to dwell within. The language of purity and fecundity has often been used to demarcate the queer as well, much as it does in FFVI. In playing with a mind towards resisting easy solutions and salvific narratives about the natural in a variety of forms, we may see the possibilities of how both narrative structure and gameplay systems in Final Fantasy and games beyond the series could push past idyllic visions of ecology and confront messy, fluid, unexpectedly queer landscapes we may dwell in both physically and digitally.",English,227,url,http://tracejournal.net/trace-issues/issue2/03-Youngblood.html,3,non_empirical,2018
260,Youngblood,1,"'"Have You Ever Heard a Worm Sing?'": The Spectral Ecology of Kentucky Route Zero, Act V","This chapter places the episodic adventure game Kentucky Route Zero in conversation with ecological theorist Timothy Morton’s ideas of spectral ecology, with a particular focus on how the game habitually ruptures the boundaries between human and nonhuman. I argue Kentucky Route Zero presents an environment marked by a mingled coexistence of ghosts, animals, humans, and trash; it is what Morton deems a “perforated world,” one where the definition of humankind comes into question and new deanthropocentric modes of living emerge. Kentucky Route Zero is not a puzzle but a space to be witnessed. It offers a lingering image of a home with open walls: a space of unbounded play with what it means to be human.",English,16,url,https://doi.org/10.2307/jj.10819591.18,3,non_empirical,2024

263,Schmidt,1,The Garden of Humanity: The Manifestation of Hope in (Post) Apocalyptic Video Games,"The purpose of this project is to explore the juxtaposition of hope before and after cataclysms in apocalyptic video games. Specifically, I will be exploring why hope is found either after the apocalyptic scenario has happened (post mortem) or just before (prope mortem). The cause of these scenarios, usually a form of human invention and/or creation, always result in a return to the natural in the aftermath of their removal, the core theme for my analysis. Considering our current environmental emergency and technological paranoia surrounding AI and other technologies, these games perpetuate the false pretense that action is not necessary, as humanity will endure. The methodology I will use for my MRP is a close reading of three games that constitute my object texts. These games are: Jak II (2003), Horizon: Zero Dawn (2017), and Final Fantasy XIII (2009). To complete this project, I will need to investigate and analyze the function of the core theme in the games, individually and as a genre by understanding their narrative structure through a closer reading with an ecocritical and hauntological lens. The major research goal of this project is therefore to understand why hope is found post-mortem. A secondary goal will be to understand why the environmental and the technological are intertwined and why games are the perfect avenue to analyze this connection. A third goal will be to postulate whether this is correlated to current day attitudes towards the environmental emergency and technological paranoia by using games as a medium from which to make cultural commentaries.",English,105,url,http://hdl.handle.net/10012/20644,8,non_empirical,2020

Starting from the “To The Last Tree Standing” campaign carried out in 2017 for Greenpeace Poland to stop the deforestation of the Białowieża forest, this research sets out to elaborate an analytical model to outline the constitutive dimensions to be taken into account in analyses of how video games and environmental activism can intersect in a specific intentional communicative instance. The results, which relied on semi-structured interviews with executives and designers (n=3) and inductive thematic analysis and sentiment analysis of the YouTube comments, delineate three initial categories (controversy, campaign network, and game ecosystem).

These digital twins of the real world, real world metaverses, are subsequently augmented by imaginary game content. However, the virtual reconstruction of the world inevitably emphasises some aspects of reality and disregards others. In this work we explore and discuss the elements of reality that are included, and omitted, in popular commercial LBGs. We focus on eight popular contemporary LBGs from five different developers and investigate their connections to the real world. Subsequently, we compare the identified real world features of the LBGs to the landscape dimensions of the widely adopted Landscape Character Assessment framework. The findings show that settlement, hydrology, climate and land cover are the most commonly incorporated landscape dimensions, albeit in low fidelity. By contrast, dimensions, such as geology, soils and enclosure were not represented in the observed LBGs. In addition, we discovered several anthropogenic and cultural aspects, such as land ownership and time depth that are implicitly included in some commercial LBGs, notably in the Niantic Wayfarer system providing unique highfidelity data of cultural and historical locations. Overall, we find only little variance within landscape dimensions between the observed commercial LBGs. Our findings open discussions on choices regarding the virtual representation of the real world in systems, such as LBGs, navigational software and a reality-based metaverse.",English,77,url,https://doi.org/10.1145/3569219.3569339,35,empirical,2022

The game includes a border-area, called the ecological dead zone. This paper leverages a multimodal framing analysis of Subnautica to examine its potential for communicating the environmental issue of ecological dead zones through this environment. The analysis investigates three key aspects: the game’s design of the dead zone, online player responses and user-generated content focused on this area. While the in-game portrayal of the dead zone is inaccurate and players often neglect it due to the lack of resources, the analysis reveals the potential for Subnautica to spark interest on ecological dead zones within the fan-base. Platforms like Reddit, Wikis and YouTube can become spaces where conversations about environmental phenomena like dead zones emerge. Even though Subnautica circulates around economic ideologies, instead of ecological ones, this analysis highlights the potential of video games to act as foundations for raising environmental awareness, especially when guided by facilitators who encourage critical thinking about environmental themes in games.",English,105,url,https://studenttheses.uu.nl/handle/20.500.12932/46402,44,empirical,2024

A combination of the game’s elements, including its comforting aesthetic, participatory community, financial mechanics, and goal-setting, promotes the player’s construction of their sense of self and provides crucial stability. In contrast to other life simulator games such as The Sims, the timing of ACNH’s release makes its substitution efforts more adoptable by a wide spectrum of players between casual and hardcore sensibilities. Moreover, the game substitutes some complex face-to-face interactions during self-isolation and it affords stability and routine through a simulacrum of real-life, however exaggerated and narrowed in scope. The gameplay provides player agency and self-determination of playstyle as well as routines that contrast with the intense disruption of the everyday by the pandemic. Players’ shared affinities and engagement with the game function as a form of serious leisure which in turn creates personas from a diverse range of roles such as, the social player, the turnip trader, the gardener, the artisan. The persona roles enable players to adopt multiple recognisable specialisations within an expansive social environment. In essence, players of ACNH create an array of malleable, interchangeable gaming personas that successfully embody the routine and social play forcibly absent from real life during the pandemic.",English,192,url,https://doi.org/10.21153/psj2020vol6no2art970,4,empirical,2020

In recent years, significant attention has been given to that question, with regard to both the historical European Middle Ages and the various medieval or medievalist worlds created in literature, television, film, and video games. The latter group, however, has focused primarily on musical elements; John Haines, for example, tackles the soundtracks of medievalist film, while Bradford Lee Eden unpacks music and musical references within Tolkien''s many novels. Ubiquitous by nature in modern representations of the medieval, but much less frequently analyzed in scholarship, is the diegetic soundscape itself—the sounds of nature, of buildings, of human or animal activity, and the like. This chapter builds on recent scholarship in ecomusicology, sound studies, video game music studies, and medieval history to unpack how modern sound designers and Foley artists create soundscapes for medieval or medievalist video games. It focuses on three main parameters: the sounds of nature (wind, water, and flora), the sounds of fauna (both human and animal), and the sounds of buildings or other spatial constructs (acoustical spaces, building material timbres), with a particular nod to the intersections of any or all of these categories.",English,54,url,https://doi.org/10.4324/9781003275305-4,3,empirical,2024

We conducted two parallel within-subjects experiments using two climate-themed games, Beyond Blue (N=36) and Plasticity (N=37), to examine the effects of persuasive game design in directing attitudes. We found that, regardless of message design, both games increased players’ cognitive attitudes after gameplay. We also found that Plasticity’s multi-layered message design (central loss-frame with a potential hopeful ending) increased short-term awareness of the climate-change threat and long-term hope for dealing with the issue, balancing fear and empowerment and emphasising the intricacies of message framing. By demonstrating the efficacy of persuasive design and environmental message framing in gameful interventions using explicit and implicit measures, our paper contributes to the application of interactive technology for effective climate-change communication in the short and long-term.",English,166,url,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2024.103439,4,empirical,2025
276,Coroller,2,Video games as a tool for ecological learning: the case of Animal Crossing,"Amidst lockdown policies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many used video games as a method to maintain a connection with others while ensuring social distancing. A new edition of the Animal Crossing series of games had been released in March 2020 and beat sales and downloads records. The game focuses on living in a natural environment, building a house and a village, as well as capturing, exhibiting, and selling species to progress. Here we examine whether players gain species identification skills andwhether it is transferred to real-lifemodels. We used the results from a survey conducted from the end of March to early April 2020 on 200 people (72 players and 128 nonplayers of Animal Crossing). Participants were first asked to rank their personal interest in nature and then to identify species from photos. The photos displayed both organisms present in the game and organisms that were not. We expected players to obtain a slightly higher score than nonplayers for questions related to the species present in the game and a similar score in both groups for questions related to species not present in the game. Multivariate analyses (multiple linear regression and principal components analysis [PCA]) showed that players were better than nonplayers at identifying real-life species that were present in the game. The role of the species in the game design impacts the ability to identify the species in real life, such as plants having mainly a role of ornamentation. Additionally, this study suggests that survey participants could correctly assess their naturalistic knowledge in general. This article shows that video games can help enhance ecological learning, improve organisms identification, and might be used as a tool for education in conservation biology.",English,19,url,https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4463,8,empirical,2023

In the interest of evaluating how popular media may reflect this value, we modified an indicator-based framework designed for evaluating the sustainability of real-world cities to fit virtual cities. We then applied this modified framework to seven video games in the city-building genre and examined how each category of indicators (water, land use, energy, clean air, social wellbeing, population density, and trade) was represented in each game. We found that social wellbeing played the most significant role in the long-term success of a city: cities with poor wellbeing struggled to maintain or increase population. Additionally, we found that games with pre-industrial settings generally rewarded sustainable practices while the industrial and post-industrial games did the opposite. Post-industrial games also significantly prioritized city growth over sustainability. Thus, the setting was a significant predictor for modelling sustainability.",English,93,url,https://dl.digra.org/index.php/dl/article/view/1344,3,empirical,2022
278,Crowley,3,The educational value of virtual ecologies in Red Dead Redemption 2,"1. Playing video games is often perceived as the antithesis of engaging with, and learning about, the natural world. Nevertheless, there is growing recognition that digital media is now a central part of many people''s lives. This has led to increased efforts to harness the power and popularity of digital games for both ecological education and conservation advocacy. 2. Games designed for educational purposes may be perceived as too niche, or have insufficient resources, to reach wider audiences. In contrast, big budget video games reach many millions of players, but are generally designed for entertainment rather than education. Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2), a Western-themed action-adventure game, is one such product. Nevertheless, due to its detailed, open-world simulation of late 19th century North American ecosystems, it provides opportunities for players to learn about real-world wildlife. 3. We surveyed self-described gamers who both had, and had not, played RDR2. Participants undertook a wildlife identification quiz focusing on 15 species depicted in the game. We also asked participants about their self-reported learning and experiences of playing RDR2. 4. We found that participants who had played RDR2 correctly identified more species in the quiz, with this improvement enhanced by having completed the game''s main storyline, played more recently or played online in a ‘Naturalist’ role. The difference in performance was greatest for ungulate and fish species which have high in-game utility value. 5. In addition to species identification, participants reported learning about animal behaviours and interspecies interactions. Their most memorable experiences were associated with RDR2''s immersive environment and ability to provoke emotional responses. 6. We conclude that big-budget video games can have educational as well as entertainment value and should be taken seriously by educators, ecologists and conservationists as a communicative force.",English,20,url,https://doi.org/10.1002/pan3.10242,5,empirical,2021

Improving this knowledge can help designers create appealing and effective ecogames. In a repeated measures design, we conducted a qualitative interventional study (N=34). In a series of interviews (short-term) and descriptive surveys (long-term), we examined how, and to what extent, a commercial eco-game (Beyond Blue, 2020) can influence participants’ environmental attitudes, biocentric awareness, and eco-motivation. Participants shared their experience of Beyond Blue’s gameplay, as well as their opinions on how to improve it and develop successful eco-games. We found that ecogames can be effective in illustrating and envisioning different ecological setups and constructing a link between people and the environment. Our findings produce design recommendations for eco-games and shed light on how enhancing the interactivity of game mechanics, persuasiveness of the narrative, immersive realism of the animation, and theme-appropriate framing can aid in conveying environmental messages. We highlight choice-driven and customisable gameplay as efficient ways to improve eco-games.",English,22,url,https://doi.org/10.1109/CoG60054.2024.10645632,4,empirical,2024

We present a framework that targets attitudinal evaluation in game design by describing how game mechanics, narrative, and animation features form player experiences that influence attitudes. To test this framework, we conducted an interventional study (N=36) using a repeated measures design that tested the effects of a climate-themed simulation game, Beyond Blue, on players’ explicit and implicit pro-environmental attitudes in both the short and long term. We also measured the effects of feature-based design (mechanics, narrative, and animation) and elemental design on attitudes. Our results showed that the climate-themed intervention impacted participants’ short-term cognitive attitudes. We also found that Beyond Blue’s overall mechanics and narrative features were the main significant predictors of pro-environmental cognitive attitudes. Challenge design was the only significant element that predicted participants’ cognitive attitudes.

282,de Haan,1,Romantic Dissonance: (the Limits to) Wandering through Nature in Open World Role-Playing Videogames,"In the fields studying arts, Romanticism and the tendency of Romantics to escape everyday life into a perfect depiction of nature, often without leaving the house, is well-known with scholars. The fact that videogames seem to follow this trend has been neglected by many. Games allow for escapist tendencies as well as a new form of immersion, namely incorporation. Additionally, open world role-playing games offer players the means to wander through nature like flâneurs. Terms such as technoromanticism and electro-Romanticism have appeared, connecting Romanticism to technology and videogames, but these accounts remain theoretical. With the help of textual analysis as described by Fernández-Vara and instrumental/free play as provided by Glas & Van Vught, this thesis delves into the Romantic in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and World of Warcraft. For one, the aestheticisation of nature is noted, consisting of the visual style of nature as well as the fact that both games are built upon mostly pre-industrial worlds. When analysing the mechanics that allow or take away from the ability to enjoy the Romantic vistas, however, it is found that a certain type of dissonance arises, different from the ludonarrative dissonance that is usually discussed by academics. Although this is noted to happen between the ludic and narrative structures in games, with the MDA framework it is shown that dissonance can also take place between mechanics and dynamics, using the Romantic nature of these games and the available interactions with this as an example.",English,105,url,https://studenttheses.uu.nl/handle/20.500.12932/27436,44,empirical,2017

288,Dunn,3,Stepping into the Wildeverse: Evaluating the impact of augmented reality mobile gaming on pro-conservation behaviours,"1. Promoting pro-conservation behaviours has become a priority for conservation organisations world-wide. Yet, current engagement strategies still face a number of barriers to creating successful interventions at the scale needed to meet global sustainability challenges. 2. Online and mobile games enjoy immense world-wide popularity, tapping into an audience not normally reached through conventional conservation outreach channels. Despite this potential to be a new, high impact and scalable platform for promoting pro-environmental behaviours, the opportunities within digital games for conservation have thus far been little explored and organisations have called for robust impact evaluations for this medium. Therefore, we investigated the effectiveness of the augmented reality game Wildeverse, which seeks to generate support for ape conservation and encourage pro-environmental behaviours. 3. We conducted a randomised control trial to experimentally compare the impacts of this game against watching a documentary, a conventional conservation outreach intervention. We compared changes in participants'' knowledge, attitudes and revealed donation behaviours across the two groups and found that games performed as well as documentaries in supporting positive environmental knowledge and attitudes. 4. The results gathered from this study provide experimental insight into the potential for the broader use of digital games for conservation outreach and also provide evidence against the argument that gaming can detract from real-world environmental problems creating a disconnect with these issues. However, results from this study could not provide any evidence that Wildeverse was successful in achieving its additional aim of encouraging players to donate to conservation, which provides evidence for the existence of an environmental values–behaviour gap in conservation gaming. 5. The gaming industry is global and rapidly growing and should no longer be ignored as an avenue for conservation outreach. We recommend several ways in which future studies can expand on this work to better understand how to effectively harness the power of digital games to drive tangible change that benefits biodiversity.",English,20,url,https://doi.org/10.1002/pan3.10273,5,empirical,2021
291,England,1,Playing with the environment: Rhetorical representations of nature and sustainability in digital game spaces,"Addressing a gap in environmental communication research, this study explores digital games as fruitful sites for academic inquiry. Specifically, this study brings together the disciplines of environmental communication, rhetoric, and game studies to examine digital game spaces in order to identify the ways in which rhetorical representations of nature and sustainability are embedded in and played through digital games, specifically The Sims Freeplay, Until Dawn, and Wasteland 2. I employ an autoethnographic methodology— the study of self in relation to larger social, cultural, and political conversations— to research my own gaming experiences, and I use a constructivist grounded theory framework to analyze the data collected from a variety of sources of game play, including gaming journal entries, theoretical research memos, and screen shots/captures. The findings from this study reveal a number of rhetorical representations of nature and sustainability exist within digital game spaces. Representations of the commodification of nature, spiritual and mythical connections to the land, humananimal relationships, and environmental collapse are prominent themes emerging from the collected data. These themes are significant because they allow the player (me) to embody particular environmental ideologies. These ideologies range from anthropocentric (human centered) to ecocentric (nature centered). By contextualizing representations and associated ideologies emerging from game play within larger material-world environmental issues and conservations, this study holds notions of “virtual” and “material” world in tension. To do so advances the argument that digital games can impact our understanding of, relationship to, and communication about environmental and sustainability issues.",English,105,url,https://www.proquest.com/openview/c6b716fff2539c1ad6d69bbf320f6690/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750,3,empirical,2016

293,Feng,1,How Game Ecology Drives Player Choices in Strategy Video Games: An Environmental Determinism Perspective,"Background: Recent years have witnessed increasing attention on the study of game ecology, the virtual environments, and underlying mechanics within games. Yet, these studies often focus on the active role that players have in changing game ecology, while overlooking the reciprocal influence between game ecology and players. Methods: This study investigates the potential impact of game ecology on player choices from an environmental determinism perspective—the development of humanity is shaped by the physical environment. This new perspective is substantiated by a case study of two strategy games, Sid Meier’s Civilization VI and Humankind, using an immersive-participatory method to analyze their game mechanics. Results: This study identifies four major forms of game mechanics that use game ecology to influence player choices: spatial constraints, movement modifiers, uncommon events, and dynamic indexes. Discussion: This study discusses how the identified game mechanics reflect environmental determinism and contrast with the conventional ideology of cultural determinism. Additionally, environmental determinism in video games, derived from a broader social background, is constantly evolving into new forms. Conclusion: This study introduces a new perspective of environmental determinism for analyzing the interaction between game ecology and players. This approach has the potential to offer valuable insights into guiding future game design and research endeavors.",English,212,url,https://doi.org/10.1177/10468781241231895,3,empirical,2024
294,Fisher,4,Could Nintendo’s Animal Crossing be a tool for conservation messaging?,"1. The current extinction crisis demands worldwide commitment to conservation across all sectors of society. By transcending the traditional disciplinary boundaries, conservationists can reach new audiences to communicate pro-conservation knowledge, education and awareness messages. 2. There are approximately 2.7 billion video-gamers worldwide, with millions more joining as a result of global lockdowns. In March 2020, Animal Crossing: New Horizons was released by Nintendo, fast becoming the second-best selling video game ever in Japan, and selling over 26.4 million units worldwide. Unlike many popular video games, its unique premise involves players creating an island, growing vegetation, catching wildlife and donating fossils and species to a museum. The game has been praised for its positivity, escapism and measurable benefits to mental well-being. 3. Here, we articulate how different features of the game, including the islands, their biodiversity and inhabitants, encourage players to exhibit pro-conservation behaviours and attitudes (e.g. recycling litter, or planting a diversity of flowers), as well as improving players’ knowledge about the diversity of relatively little known taxa (marine and freshwater fishes and invertebrates). We also highlight where pitfalls exist (e.g. encouraging the collection of threatened species). We principally frame these discussions in the context of Japan''s cultural relationship with the natural world, including its history of insect-collecting and its management of green spaces. We conclude by outlining some recommendations about potential improvements to future releases, or for similar games, that could further promote conservation messaging. 4. This perspective sheds light on the avenues through which Animal Crossing: New Horizons encourages pro-conservation knowledge, attitudes and behaviours of its international audience, with potential for these experiences to translate into real-world conservation actions. During a critical time in humanity''s history, video gaming could therefore provide a huge opportunity for communicating conservation messages to billions of people worldwide.",English,20,url,https://doi.org/10.1002/pan3.10240,5,empirical,2021
295,Fisher,3,"Minecraft, Mangroves, and Dialogic Potential: An Analysis of Video Game Live Streaming and its Implications for Public Relations Research","Video game live streaming platforms like Twitch are important sites for strategic communication and public relations activity given the potential for co-creation, dialogic engagement, and relationship building that they afford. In these dynamic spaces, passionate, highly engaged publics seeking social interaction and community gather to watch streamers play their favorite games; and through these spaces organizations have an opportunity to reach an audience that is less likely to consume traditional media. Yet, despite their growing popularity, video games and the practice of video game live streaming remain understudied within the field of public relations. This study works to extend the nascent body of literature in this area through an analysis of Minecraft and The Nature Conservancy’s Rooted Together project, designed to educate audiences about and raise money for mangrove conservation efforts. Using a textual analysis of two charity live streams, this study considers how the devotional-promotional model maps onto relationships between streamers, stakeholders, and organizations in the context of a platform that affords space for dialogic engagement.

This concept marks a continuity between the literary genre of “nature writing” and the way nature may be contemplatively experienced in video games, especially those with open-world natural landscapes. The author will discuss modes of nature playing within the mediated environments of the sports simulation game Riders Republic (Ubisoft, 2022). Nature playing will be analyzed as an aesthetic practice which may be fostered by purposeful design, or it may emerge from the player’s own nature-driven sensibilities triggered by the aesthetic qualities of the game world. The author frames contemplative nature playing within a variety of concepts such as in-game wandering, slow play as well as ludic boredom. The article culminates in three autoethnographic ludic interventions, in which nature playing is captured in three contemplative pieces of nature writing.",English,152,url,https://doi.org/10.1177/15554120241273329,47,empirical,2024

Millions of players are able to explore virtual landscapes that resemble the real world, yet significant differences exist. This study investigates the geographical accuracy of 15 open-world video games. The virtual landscapes in these games were analyzed for horizontal distance compression, increased slopes, idealized climate, simplified vegetation and water features, underpopulation, and spatial segregation of ethnic minorities. The findings show significant differences between the games in terms of their geographical accuracy, with some exhibiting a more realistic representation of the natural and cultural environment compared to others.

299,Fraile-Jurado,3,Toward Realism: An Analysis of Coastal Environments in Open-World Video Games,"This study examines the fidelity of coastal environments depicted in open-world video games, aiming to evaluate the accuracy and representation of various coastal features. Through a systematic analysis of 20 selected video games, encompassing diverse settings and developers, coastal elements such as beaches, cliffs, and tidal marshes were scrutinized. A bespoke asymmetric indicator, tailored to each game’s unique coastal landscape, was employed, drawing upon 32 descriptive variables initially proposed by coastal experts. The findings reveal significant variation in the representation of coastal features across different games, with some demonstrating high fidelity, while others exhibit simplifications or omissions. Notably, games like Red Dead Redemption 2 and Assassin’s Creed series excel in capturing the complexity of coastal environments, while others fall short in their simulation. These findings underscore the potential for video games to serve as immersive educational tools for understanding coastal ecosystems, emphasizing the need for enhanced fidelity and accuracy in their representation. Further research in this domain could contribute to the development of more realistic and educational gaming experiences, fostering greater awareness and appreciation of coastal environments among players.",English,212,url,https://doi.org/10.1177/10468781241287900,45,empirical,2024
300,Gabrielaitis,5,“Beavers don’t walk on roads”: Beaver-play for more-than-human cartographies,"In this paper, we introduce the notion of beaver-play to understand play that challenges spatial conventions, transgresses boundaries, and redraws territories. Tracing how beavers are imagined in various contexts such as nature conservation, experimental rewilding practices, and performance art, we highlight the role of the beaver in stories of ecosystem management, collapse, and restoration. We investigate beaver imaginaries through the perspective of play and games, taking the popular citybuilding video game Timberborn as our case study. We employ sketching as a method to annotate and analyse play practices in the digital spaces of Timberborn, drawing out three modes of beaver-play: concerns, crossings, and flows. Highlighting the role of play in territorial and organisational fluidity, we draw attention to the way that beaver-play scaffolds moving in and out of spatial arrangements, territories and environmental systems. Discussing how the practices of playing and drawing intertwined into a process of more-than-human cartography, we extend our investigation to consider the broader implications of using video games as cartographic, performative spaces for more-thanhuman meaning-making.",English,100,url,https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3669/paper11.pdf,46,empirical,2024

Applying the practice of soundwalking to gameplay revealed the subtle yet significant role of listening in Stardew Valley’s gameplay that is not explicitly stated in the directions for the game. Video games demand that we listen past this implicit assumption and come to understand how the “digital” and “natural” converge in productive ways to reframe and extend public discourse surrounding the environment. Stardew Valley and other environmental games take places seriously in their rendering of environments, but also in their detailed weather conditions and the interactions among human and nonhuman-organic and inorganic actors.

In this discussion of the aquatic ecosystem modeling and sound design of Abzû and its relationship to narrative and game mechanics, the author applies approaches from the blue humanities and Stefan Helmreich’s concept of the “alien ocean,” a term he reclaims from the marine biologists who used it to describe the “strangeness” of the creatures they were investigating, to address how players interact with and come to understand in-game deep-sea soundscapes that are beyond human perception and experienced by playing as an AI exploration entity. The article considers how inequities in power and agency are translated into constructions of knowledge and the epistemological framing and scoring the nonhuman “other” (and what that communicates about being human) in environmental art that explores environments uninhabited by human life.

304,Gislam,1,The Effect of the Non-Human on the Generation of Narrative and Space in Digital Games,"This thesis investigates entanglements between digital game narratives and non-human matter through a framework of game space which draws on theories of spatial production and non-human agency as well as insights from the Gothic. The framework proposed in this thesis positions non-human matter as both space and narrative co-constructors, existing alongside, and working with, players, and developers. By way of this framework the project contributes significantly to the understanding of how game space, narrative, and players intersect, highlighting the ways in which these identities emerge from their relations. Through a close reading of three Gothic game texts The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth + (Nicalis, 2017), Bloodborne (From Software, 2015), and Death Stranding (Kojima Productions, 2019), the research explores the ways in which non-human matter, specifically procedural content generation, non-player characters, and game space, are agentive aspects working alongside the human player in the generation of narrative. As such, this thesis identifies games as sites of collaboration between the human and the non-human. The thesis is structured to trace the entanglements between player and game steadily outwards, beginning in the intra-story world of the game, leading, ultimately, to the imbrication of games with the wider phenomena of the climate crisis. Each chapter is connected through the problematising of human-centred notions of space and finds that in their co-construction of narrative and space, digital games illuminate current anxieties surrounding consumption and the environment. By the conclusion the thesis finds that digital games are not only part of the entanglements which form what we understand as the climate crisis but are also folded into the crisis themselves, from their development, shipment, and consumption to how they reinforce harmful notions of nature as a hub of resources open for extraction. As a result, the findings of my research contribute to emerging scholarship in game studies that seeks to recentre the non-human in explorations of space and narrative.",English,105,url,https://e-space.mmu.ac.uk/id/eprint/634136,5,empirical,2023

However, it remains unclear how to engender such processes. In this thesis, I aim to address this gap in knowledge through the exploration of the potential role of virtual sustainability games in engendering psycho-social transformation. I examine the research objective through a qualitative case study of Eco, an online virtual sustainability game. Based on a broad range of theoretical literature, the thesis has identified and developed four qualities that can have transformative potential. The relevance of the four qualities has been tested through confrontation with empirical data, suggesting some positive results. Further comparative studies would be required to explore how different sustainability-oriented video games (or perhaps other forms of media and art) engage the four theoretically-derived qualities I have explored in this thesis – or others that remain to be identified – and the degree to which these shape their transformative potential and outcomes.

311,Haugom,1,When Ludology and Narratology Meet: A Comparative Analysis of an Ecofictional Video Game and an Ecofictional Book,"In this master’s thesis, I study the representations of the relationship between the main characters and their wider environment in the ecofictional video game A New Beginning (Final Cut) (2012) by Daedalic Entertainment and in the ecofictional book Code Blue (2018) by Marissa Slaven. The aim of this study is to explore and expand on the ecocritical research on video games and books within the children’s and young adult (YA) literary field of study. The study is innovative because it utilizes Espen Aarseth’s “A Narrative Theory of Games” (2012), which is originally intended to be used while studying video games, to analyse and compare a video game and a novel. Therefore, this master’s thesis is titled “When Ludology and Narratology Meet. A Comparative Analysis of an Ecofictional Video Game and an Ecofictional Book”, because it uses theory and approaches from both fields of study. To analyse the book and the video game ecocritically, I have used the analytical tool “The Nature in Culture Matrix” (The NatCul Matrix) developed by the research group “Nature in Children’s Literature and Culture” (NaChiLitCul), as presented in the book Ecocritical Perspectives on Children’s Texts and Cultures. Nordic Dialogues (Goga, Guanio-Uluru, Hallås and Nyrnes, 2018). I have divided the analysis into three stages (A, B and C). In stage A, I analysed excerpts from the video game and the book in accordance with Aarseth’s (2012) four categories. I decided to combine the categories into pairs: “World and events” and “characters and objects”. In stage B, I used The NatCul Matrix to analyse the representations of the relationship between the main characters and their wider environment that I found in each category from Aarseth’s theory. I placed the categories in regards to the axes and the dimension of “techne” in the NatCul Matrix. First, I analysed and placed each category from the video game into the matrix, separately. Then, I did the same with the categories in the book. The NatCul Matrix has a vertical axis that describes attitudes from a celebrating to a problematizing of nature, and a horizontal axis showing a continuum between the ecocentric horizon and the anthropocentric horizon. The last dimension of the matrix circumscribes the notion of techne, which emphasizes that all works are created by humans and for humans. In stage C, I analysed and compared the representations of the relationship between the main characters and their wider environment, which I found in the categories “world and events” and “characters and objects” in the video game with the corresponding representations that I found in the categories in the book. I did this by comparing how the different categories were placed within The NatCul Matrix in both the video game and the book. Within all the three analysis stages, I have drawn on Wolfgang Iser’s (1972, p. 285) reader-response theory, in particular his term “gap”, which I used to analyse the differences and similarities of interpreting a story as a player and as a reader, and to gather information about the relationship between the main characters and their wider environment. The findings reveal that the representations of the relationship between the main characters and their wider environment reside within the portrayal of the world and events, and in the interactions between the characters and the objects filling the respective works’ portrayal of the world. Because these representations exist within human-made stories, in a video game and a book, the representations are mediated and will inherently carry representations of how humans position themselves in relation to nature. I also found that it is possible to ecocritically compare representations of the relationship between the main characters and their wider environment in a video game and a book, by using a theoretical framework that combines ludology and narratology.",English,105,url,https://hvlopen.brage.unit.no/hvlopen-xmlui/handle/11250/2601276,43,empirical,2019

The present study examines the correlation between players’ environmental attitudes and their interaction with virtual natural resources. This study constructs Bayesian ordinal logistic models to analyze survey data of 640 Animal Crossing: New Horizon (ACNH) players from 29 countries. Results show that the frequency of catching in-game animals (fish and insects) is positively correlated with the level of human centeredness in environmental attitudes. In addition, less anthropocentric players tend to use more sustainable methods to collect woods in ACNH. Such a particular way of interacting with in-game animals and trees based on their species may be attributable to players’ environmental attitudes and game designs.This paper discusses how game design can play a role in promoting proenvironmental behaviors and highlights the moral implications of interactions with non-human beings.",English,28,url,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-022-01742-y,9,empirical,2022

During the COVID-19 lockdown, Nintendo’s Animal Crossing: New Horizon (ACNH) became a household name, with millions of copies sold worldwide. The article used the Bayesian multilevel model to analyze 640 survey responses of ACNH game players from various online communities. The correlations between the perception of limited resources and virtual planting and exploiting behaviors with the varying effect among ethnicities were explored. The findings suggested positive correlations between the perception and in-game actions among all ethnicities, regardless of whether the actions are planting or exploiting. While further evidence is needed, the findings suggest the restraints of game mechanics.

However, literature has so far largely neglected a connection between environmental sustainability and commercial video games. Therefore, this thesis analyses environmental sustainability incorporations in commercial video games by conducting a case study on Horizon Forbidden West (HFW). This case study is executed with help of an originally developed analytical model called Dimensions of Environmentally Sustainable Gameplay. The case study concludes that HFW especially excels in creating a realistic environmentally sustainable game world. Other dimensions of environmentally sustainable gameplay such as environmental objects, agents and events, need more improvement. HFW shows problematic incorporation of video game objects as it is merely based on mastering the environment in the form of resource extraction. The research findings indicate that HFW’s producers have not yet uncovered the medium’s full potential. This thesis encourages further research into environmental sustainability in commercial video games and provides commercial video game producers with the necessary tools to create future games with improved environmental considerations.",English,105,url,https://hj.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1678227&dswid=-3605,42,empirical,2022

This thesis thus aims to investigate this issue by conducting a game analysis based on a framework of respect for nature, which will be established as a foundational aspect of this paper. From the game analysis, lessons and design principles that can be employed in future game design to foster respect for nature in players will be collated.",English,105,url,https://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&c=6&af=%5B%5D&searchType=LIST_LATEST&sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&query=&language=en&pid=diva2%3A1762529&aq=%5B%5B%5D%5D&sf=all&aqe=%5B%5D&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&noOfRows=50&dswid=-4798,42,empirical,2023
320,Jepson,2,Nature apps: Waiting for the revolution,"Apps are small task-orientated programs with the potential to integrate the computational and sensing capacities of smartphones with the power of cloud computing, social networking, and crowdsourcing. They have the potential to transform how humans interact with nature, cause a step change in the quantity and resolution of biodiversity data, democratize access to environmental knowledge, and reinvigorate ways of enjoying nature. To assess the extent to which this potential is being exploited in relation to nature, we conducted an automated search of the Google Play Store using 96 nature-related terms. This returned data on *36 304 apps, of which *6301 were nature-themed. We found that few of these fully exploit the full range of capabilities inherent in the technology and/or have successfully captured the public imagination. Such breakthroughs will only be achieved by increasing the frequency and quality of collaboration between environmental scientists, information engineers, computer scientists, and interested publics.",English,28,url,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-015-0712-2,5,empirical,2015
321,Jolly,2,Assessing the Extent to Which Players Can Build Sustainable Cities in the Digital City-Builder Game “Cities: Skylines”,"This paper examines whether the commercial digital simulation game “Cities: Skylines” enables players to simulate sustainable city development. The analysis consists of an analytical framework founded on the literature regarding the UN Sustainable Development Goal “Sustainable Cities and Communities” (SDG 11, United Nations). The study applies the analytical framework to the city builder, observing that many aspects of sustainable city development can be employed when building a city in “Cities: Skylines”. While the analysis suggests that the in-game feedback is very neutral vis-à-vis sustainability, the game offers a vast digital space where players and pupils learning geography can practically experience and experiment with the complexity of urban geography. Thus, “Cities: Skylines” could offer the opportunity to familiarize learners with “Sustainable Cities and Communities”. The analysis helps to assess the extent to which the game can be of educational benefit for geography education despite its commercial character. The paper concludes with educational implications and emphasizes the opportunity to experience sustainable city development in the digital simulation game “Cities: Skylines”.",English,217,url,https://doi.org/10.3390/su151410780,47,empirical,2023

LBGs are designed to be played outdoors, and past research has shown that they can incentivize players to travel to nature. To further explore this nature-connection, we investigated via a mixed-methods approach the connections between engagement with LBGs, inspiration and environmental awareness as follows. First, we identifed relevant gamifcation features in Study 1. Based on the insights, we built a survey that we sent to Pokémon GO players (N=311) in Study 2. The results showed that (a) social networking features, reminders, and virtual objects were the most relevant gamifcation features to explain inspired by playing Pokémon GO and that (b) inspired to outdoor engagement partially mediated the relationship between inspired by playing Pokémon GO and environmental awareness. These results warrant further investigations into whether LBGs could motivate pro-environment attitudes and inspire people to care for nature.",English,101,url,https://doi.org/10.1145/3613904.3642786,47,empirical,2024

In order to explore what dynamics in these games incentivize travel to specific places or areas, we engaged in interviews with active players. We discovered 11 unique game dynamics, which could be positioned under three overarching themes: (1) the playing field, as determined by the placement of points of interest, the players’ habitat and their surroundings; (2) the player communities and real life relationships, which motivated and directed the playing; and (3) coincidental motivational support, which highlighted how location-based games offer multi-layered motivation for players to travel to, and engage with, specific real-world locations.

324,Korhonen,1,A Final Fantasy of eco-lifestyle - A case study of environmental agency in two video games,"The focus of this thesis is on environmental agency in two different video games, The Sims 4 Eco Lifestyle and Final Fantasy VII Remake. The research questions aim to answer how the player can act as an environmental agent in these two games and what are the key differences between these games. The study is executed in a form of qualitative two-case case study with the help of close reading. With close reading eight different types of agencies that form the typology of this study, will be analysed in order to answer the research questions. The data for this thesis was collected by playing both games and taking notes by following close reading. The notes were then analysed with the different types of agencies. The results showed clear overlapping of the types of agencies, and it could be said that environmental agency can be used better in the game when the overlapping is happening. The agencies complemented each other and made the possible learning process in the game more fulfilling. The main difference between the game seems to be that The Sims 4 Eco Lifestyle as a life simulation game offers more diverse possibilities for environmental player agency. The studies about environmental games are mainly focused on serious games and not so much on commercial games. Video games hold great potential to engage people in environmental things especially with the help of player agency. It offers the player the ability to make meaningful choices and if they are structure well, the player can see the consequences of their agency which serves as an effective feedback which could lead to positive learning. In this case, the environmental agency in the game could be transformed into real-life environmental agency. As video games have become more immersive and their environments more realistic, it could be worth considering that separating virtual environment from the real-life one might not be necessary anymore. Therefore, games like The Sims 4 Eco Lifestyle and Final Fantasy VII Remake could serve as an example of how environmental agency within them could be harnessed into wider use.",English,105,url,https://core.ac.uk/outputs/479169147/?utm_source=pdf&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=pdf-decoration-v1,46,empirical,2021

Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain took Cold War as the main story background tells the story differently. The game system of this video game offers freedom to players to interact with anything during the gameplay, but this freedom has consequences. Applying social semiotic approach, this paper aims to identify how appraisal theory and narrative representation can be used to promote ecological awareness. After observing, collecting and viewing, transcribing and analyzing multimodal data, the researchers find that killing non-playable characters in form of human and animals and even enemy will reduce the score which is important in developing the playable characters’ weapons and equipment. Adopting the theory from Martin & White in appraisal theory and Kress and van Leewuen, Caple in narrative representation, this paper also finds that appraisal theory is used to guide the players to play in ethical way such as using non-lethal weaponry, capturing wild animals to protect them from war, and collecting medical plants as needed only, besides, the enemy soldiers can be hired and give beneficial results to the players when they are used to play. In narrative representation, the freedom of choices is designed to make ethical play more plausible.",English,183,url,https://doi.org/10.30743/ll.v7i2.8198,22,empirical,2023
326,Kvist,1,A Crisis of the Imagination: Games as a Tool for Visualizing Potential Futures,"In order for the societal paradigm to shift in favor of climate-conscious practices and behaviors, it is clear that new and radically different perspectives need to be introduced to the public’s perception of climate change and sustainability. Humanity is currently suffering from a crisis of the imagination; the illustrious yet hegemonic worldview that we have exhausted all options available to us in the face of climate change. This locks our future in to a set trajectory, as other options that may be unlikely yet possible and (un)desirable are ignored. Through the use of interactive media, specifically commercial video games, such radically different perspectives on the future can be presented to large audiences on a global scale and with instantaneous distribution. Commercial games are able to, through the interplay between interactivity, narrative intrigue and symbolic/ empathetic resonance, create worldmaking interactions which may in turn lead to escape velocity; a possible way to break free of the crisis of the imagination. The empirical foundation for the thesis was gathered through interviews with gamers from all over the world, in which participants shared their stories about gaming, sustainability and climate change. The thesis found that commercial video games are able to aid in the visualization of potential futures by offering worldmaking interactions. The strongest argument for using commercial video games as a conduit for worldmaking interactions seem to be their ability to appeal to our sense of empathy. Further, the thesis found that in this, commercial games are in some ways superior to serious games, though a joining of aspects from both types of games seem to hold greater potential still. Arguments can be made that commercial games lack transferability of experience, though the empirical results of this thesis seem to at least partially discredit this. Further research is needed to assert this fact more firmly. Keeping the empirical results in mind, the thesis offers a simple framework for developers to use in the development of commercially viable games aimed at worldmaking interactions for sustainability.",English,105,url,https://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&c=27&af=%5B%5D&searchType=LIST_LATEST&sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&query=&language=sv&pid=diva2%3A1841625&aq=%5B%5B%5D%5D&sf=all&aqe=%5B%5D&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&noOfRows=50&dswid=3005,42,empirical,2023

This study investigates tensions that arise in augmenting the mundane experience of walking in both urban and nature environments with location-based games (LBGs). We conducted an 8-week autoethnographic study of a newly launched LBG, Pikmin Bloom, a game that can be characterised as gamified walking. We focused on the central design tension of “augmenting walking vs. avoiding disturbing players’ everyday life.” Connected to this, we discuss four other tensions: (1) promise of future vs. enjoyable present; (2) too abundant vs. too scarce rewards; (3) seeking symbiosis vs. manipulating the environment; and (4) player privacy vs. immersive gameplay. This work-in-progress suggests that failing to optimally balance these tensions can have detrimental effects on the playing experience.",English,79,url,https://doi.org/10.1145/3491101.3519785,46,empirical,2022

For this reason, it is worth looking into technologies that could direct people to these activities. In this study, we focused on location-based games (LBGs) to identify and elucidate opportunities that the games provide for forest-goers, landowners and the forest industry. We invited experts from the fields of gamification (n=5), forestry (n=8) and others (n=3) to a design workshop on this topic. Using a qualitative analysis and synthesis to organize the generated workshop material, we ended up with eight potential aspects where LBGs could benefit forest-goers, and six categories of use cases where the games could benefit landowners and the forest industry.

Concurrently, location-based games (LBGs), such as Pok´emon GO, have become a prominent game-technological trend, which influences players’ movement out and about in nature. Therefore, LBGs could potentially provide a fruitful development to re-establish some of the human-nature relationships lost in urbanization and industrialization. The aim of this study, therefore, is to explore how contemporary LBGs affect peoples’ relationship with nature. We conducted a qualitative study through semi-structured interviews among LBG players. We focused on two complementary seeding points of departure, (1) what aspects of the games affect how players interact with nature and/or are enticed to move in nature, and (2) how LBGs affect the experience in and of nature. The findings detail the multifaceted and bi-directional relationship of how LBGs affect players’ perceptions of nature, but simultaneously, nature changes and shapes players’ movement and experiences, potentially resulting in increased well-being and more sustainable gaming praxis.",English,98,url,https://doi.org/10.24251/hicss.2023.396,46,empirical,2023

Past research has showed that gamified map-based apps and locationbased games (LBGs) have the capability to incentivize people to go to nature areas in cities and beyond. In this study, we explored LBGs’ potential to bring people to nature by conducting a field experiment with a new mechanic called Routes in the popular LBG Pokémon GO. Prior to the Route feature’s launch, we created altogether 13 Routes of various lengths in both city and nature landscapes. We collected numerical in-game data of how many times each Route was walked and deployed a survey (n=67) for Pokémon GO players in the area where the Routes were made. The findings suggest that proximity to population concentrations and in-game rewards are key drivers of Route popularity. Players’ motivators to choose nature Routes over urban Routes were limited to outside-the-game factors such as scenery, and overall in our experiment the urban Routes turned out to be more popular.",English,198,url,https://doi.org/10.1145/3677075,46,empirical,2024
332,Larreina‑Morales,2,Video games for environmental awareness: the accessibility gap,"Video games addressing environmental issues have the potential to raise awareness among players about the pressing ecological crisis and motivate them to take individual and collective action towards sustainability. For these games to generate change on a large scale, everyone should be able to play them. However, persons with disabilities often encounter accessibility barriers that prevent or hinder their access to these games. This paper aims to bridge the gap between environmental awareness and accessibility by analysing three video games: Plasticity, Alba: A Wildlife Adventure, and The Sims 4: Eco Lifestyle. First, their environmental themes are examined. Second, their accessibility features are listed and assessed using a mixed-methods tool that combines a quantitative checklist with a user qualitative evaluation. Results show that these three games are similar in their exploration and slow-paced mechanics but lack a specific focus on accessibility, particularly regarding visual, hearing, and haptic stimuli. This leads to a reduced gaming experience for some players, and complete unplayability for others, especially users in need of visual accessibility features. To improve the situation, accessibility should be co-created with users and implemented from the design stage of the game. Future research includes analysing a larger selection of games, directly involving players in the assessment of accessibility features, and reception research examining the impact of environmental awareness on players with and without disabilities. In short, to bridge the accessibility gap in environmental awareness, it is crucial to prioritise inclusivity in video games so that everyone can participate in creating a more sustainable world.",English,229,url,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10209-023-01026-6,45,empirical,2023

Given the rise of ecocentric games during the COVID-19 pandemic, this research examines how FF7R_inter incorporates environmental themes and the potential impact of these themes on players’ ecological awareness. Utilizing an ecolinguistic discourse analysis approach, the study investigates the linguistic and multimodal resources used in the game to frame environmental issues such as fossil fuel dependency and eco-terrorism from a multiversal inter-reality perspective. The findings reveal that FF7R_inter employs specific rhetorical strategies, including differences in ecological framings and semantic choices, to convey ecological messages, thereby contributing to the broader discourse on environmental sustainability in pop culture. This research highlights the significant role that digital games can play in shaping public perceptions of environmental issues and underscores the importance of integrating ecolinguistic perspectives into the analysis of digital media.",English,178,url,https://doi.org/10.1075/jlpop.24012.law,21,empirical,2024

Consequently, species biodiversity is threatened, while the innate relationship between humans and nature begins to fade gradually. Urban green spaces play a vital role in reconnecting human and urbanized landscape with its unique characteristics. Meanwhile, virtual gaming technology with applied geographic information has made a spectacular process to promote interactions between humans and their surroundings. A novel approach of combining Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, ground-based inventory data, geographic information system (GIS) data, and geocoordinates derived from reality game Pokémon GO was applied to explore geospatial gaming technology’s application in mapping cultural use and biodiversity hotspots at a university campus. Five types of green space were identified: lawn, planting bed, planting bed on structure, athletic field, and urban forest. In order to capture a relatively complete understanding of cultural perception and vegetation biodiversity value, two green space assessments were conducted with a combination of factors: namely native species ratio, species richness, canopy cover and cultural interest. Both assessments highlighted the importance of urban forest. This green space type achieved 0.396 in the first assessment and 0.501 for the second assessment of cultural and biodiversity values.

We draw upon “ecological thought”—a mode of awareness that highlights the radical interconnectedness of all beings and their environments—to consider the ecological dynamics of city-building by the game’s players. Analyzing player-generated paratexts from online game communities reveals that while many players aspire toward ecocentric city designs, they instead inadvertently restage the asymmetric planetary relationship emblematic of our current era. Our analysis uncovers the capital-driven assumptions that characterize human–environment relations in the game. Attempts at ecocentric aesthetics invariably subsumed by cybernetic interactions that privilege the Anthropocene’s prevailing power dynamics.

346,Morawski,2,Gaming & Geography (Education): A Model of Reflexive Analysis of Space & Action in Video Games,"Since philosophical turns such as the spatial turn etc., geography has been dealing more intensively with the subjective perception and construction of space. Video games, and especially the vast digital spaces therein, are devel-oped by teams of programmers, developers, and designers who make creative spatial construction decisions based on different worldviews, experiences, values, and skills. These processes result in a specific intended spatial experience for players to traverse. However, these players also approach the games with certain worldviews, prior experiences, values, etc., and the question arises to what extent spatial experiences can be intentionally passed through and what conse-quences the perception has for the (young) players we address with geography instruction. Thus, there is undoubtedly communication between both sides about digital space in video games. Furthermore, the question arises what role the creation of digital spaces in the games plays for the experience, understanding and reception of real analog spaces as well as for the further competences of students1 like, exemplary, in the field of sustainability or decision reflections. Thus, it cannot be dismissed that an engagement with video games should play a stronger role in the context of address-ing the reflection of spatial perceptions and constructions in geography education. Yet, they are still largely underrepre-sented in studies of geography education and many studies lack sufficient empirical proof and orientation for teacher professionalization. In the paper, results from the research project '"Gaming & Geography'" will be presented, which attempts to create further legitimizing foundations for the integration of video games as a medium in the didactic dis-course of geography via a mixed method a-proach and transfer services for teachers. Based on the research in the project, a model for reflexive analysis of digital space and action in video games will also be presented, which should facilitate a stronger and more serious didactic integration of video games in geographic education. The results of the study provide a significant contribution to take the medium of video games as a geographical medium more seriously and the study provides further establishment measures to use the presented model didactically, because they show that students actively engage in geographic contexts in games, they reflect on the contexts presented and the experts encourage the necessity of the presented model.",English,149,url,https://doi.org/10.48088/ejg.m.mor.14.3.001.019,47,empirical,2023

These exercise television games often contain references to physical activities carried out in different outdoor landscapes. The purpose of this article is to examine the views of landscape and nature offered by the games and the consequences this may have for students’ relationships with nature and future environmental commitment. The methodological approach used is companion meaning analysis: the meaning of nature that follows when playing the games. The results show a controlled landscape that is perfectly arranged for the activity (functional specialisation). It is an obvious anthropocentric base and commands an instrumental value where nature is valuable because it satisfies our felt preferences (demand value). Exergames can thus be seen as a further step in an ongoing detachment process from the physical landscape (indoorisation).",English,171,url,https://doi.org/10.1080/14729679.2016.1147965,42,empirical,2016

Incorporating playfulness into ecological education initiatives can attract more interest in these aspects of ecology. Over the last three decades Pokémon has engaged with millions of people by replicating many aspects of real-world wildlife in cartoons and games. Studies have speculated how the Pokémon franchise creates opportunities for didactic purposes. This study aims to identify the potential for ecological interactions portrayed in the Pokémon universe to contribute to children''s engagement and learning. We first gathered information on all the ecological interactions described among Pokémon ‘species’ from the franchise’s website. We found 150 Pokémon species engaging in an array of different ecological interactions. We tested the use of Pokémon as a teaching tool about ecological interactions to high-school students aged ≥ 18 years. The use of Pokémon significantly increased learning of almost half of ecological interactions and raised engagement, particularly among students who like the franchise. Our findings show that Pokémon can be a playful and didactic tool for teaching about ecological interactions.",English,173,url,https://doi.org/10.1080/00219266.2022.2026803,60,empirical,2024
357,Reed,3,Young people's networked constructions of nature: Evidence from a qualitative multiple case study in the United Kingdom,"1. How young people interpret and engage with nature is an important consideration within our current biodiversity and climate crises. What remains less clear are the ways in which online, networked, spaces underpin young people''s relationships with nature, and what consequences these spaces may have for in-person nature interactions. 2. Given the ubiquitousness of networked spaces in society, it has been argued that day-to-day life is increasingly ‘postdigital’, in that we may no longer distinguish meaningful differences between our online and offline worlds. Therefore, it is necessary to examine this collapsing physical-digital binary in the context of young people''s in-person interactions with nature to examine the effectiveness of this theoretical perspective. 3. Utilising ethnographically situated, participant-as-observer methods, this qualitative multiple case study generated data across three rural residential outdoor education centres in England, Scotland and Wales, with young people aged 12–17. Participants were visiting the residential centres from urban schools in England and Scotland, with each group spending 5 days at their respective centre. 4. Reflexive thematic analysis of fieldnote data revealed that young people had previously constructed their understandings and interpretations of what nature ‘is’ through networked environments such as Instagram, TikTok and Minecraft. These networked constructions often contextualised young people''s direct, in-person interactions with nature and demonstrated ways in which these online spaces influenced how nature was perceived and understood. The case is presented for interpreting the findings from a postdigital ‘networked baselines’ perspective. 5. The findings will resonate with practitioners and policymakers concerned with the relationships between young people, networked spaces and nature connectedness. Alongside this, given the editorial discussion on the impacts of ‘nature on screen’ from Silk et al. (2021) in People and Nature, this paper provides a set of empirical findings on how young people''s organic engagements with nature on-screen provided a degree of foundational knowledge about what nature is, what nature is for and how nature should be engaged with.",English,20,url,https://doi.org/10.1002/pan3.10781,5,empirical,2025
358,Rogers,1,Into the Wilds: Influences from Video Games on Our Perception of 'Nature',"In this paper I examine how representations of human-sparse natural environments, e.g. wilderness, influence what expectations we have when we actually engage with comparable physical places. I use Don Ihde''s phenomenology of technology to describe my own experiences playing three games that take place among large photorealistic human-sparse natural environments: Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Horizon Zero Dawn, and theHunter: Call of the Wild. I also conduct a brief literature review on the effects of video games as interactive media on players. I argue that players are capable of applying their expectations of what constitutes realism from digital to physical environments, and that some of these translocations (transferring the perceptual framework from one space to another) limit our ability to meaningfully engage with the world. Although some video games may condition players to hyperreal expectations that leave them disappointed with physical spaces, some games might also produce increased interest and care for human-sparse spaces. The causal relationship between playing video games, changing expectations, and offline behavior therefore merits further study. I conclude with the claim that our experiences with unmediated physical nature should ground our perceptual baselines, rather than evaluating the physical by the standards of the digital.",English,105,url,https://scholarworks.umt.edu/etd/11187/,3,empirical,2018
359,Roncken,1,How Players Interact with Sustainability in Eco,"Some types of resource management and simulation games often inadvertently deal with the concept of resource exploitation which is a natural outcome of emulating real-world systems in a digital environment. Sustainable decision-making is imperative for humanity’s sustained survival and teaching the general populace about sustainability and climate through interactive media has proven to be an effective tool in increasing such decision-making. ECO (2018) is a game that deals with a simulated climate that reacts to the player’s actions, this makes it a potential candidate for teaching its players about climate change and sustainable decisionmaking. This paper looks at ECO (2018) through a close reading with the help of a set of analytical lenses to ascertain the player’s relationship with sustainability in the game. The extent to which the game’s simulated climate is interwoven with all other aspects of its progression shows its potential for being a tool used in sustainability education in spite of the fact that it ultimately emphasises innovation over sustainability as the main driver of the player’s decision making.",English,105,url,https://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&c=37&af=%5B%5D&searchType=LIST_LATEST&sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&query=&language=sv&pid=diva2%3A1811216&aq=%5B%5B%5D%5D&sf=all&aqe=%5B%5D&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&noOfRows=50&dswid=8254,42,empirical,2023

370,Santacreu,1,Représentation critique de la nature dans les jeux vidéo post-apocalyptiques : étude du jeu The Last of Us,"La question environnementale est ancrée médiatiquement depuis longtemps. Aussi bien sociale, économique que politique, l’environnement et plus largement la nature sont des éléments qui alimentent le débat dans les magazines, les journaux télévisés, la radio et tout autre média bénéficiant d’une large audience. En qualité de médium hybride, au croisement d’une expérience audiovisuelle interactive unique, ludique et narrative, les jeux vidéo se sont emparés de la thématique de la nature il y a longtemps et sous diverses formes. Mais à quelles fins? Si les jeux dits sérieux sont de plus en plus présents dans le domaine de la recherche académique, les jeux principalement axés sur le divertissement ont aussi une capacité à se saisir du sujet et à persuader ou faire prendre conscience de l’urgence d’agir. Afin de répondre à ce questionnement, The Last of Us, développé par Naughty Dog et édité par Sony Interactive Entertainment est l’une des expériences vidéoludiques les plus pertinentes. Prenant place dans un univers science-fictionnel de post-apocalypse et narrant une dystopie, il est possible de se poser la question de recherche suivante : en quoi un jeu basé sur un univers post-apocalyptique et à destination du grand public peut-il être source de représentation critique de la nature? Par le biais de plusieurs éléments, issus de la théorie des cadres, de la dystopie critique et de l’approche ludonarrative en étude du jeu notamment, ainsi qu’en utilisant une méthode d’analyse qualitative et une approche sémiopragmatique, nous avons pu montrer que la dystopie critique mise en place par le jeu laisse entrevoir une lueur d’espoir dans univers sombre et que cet espoir est étroitement lié à la nature comme élément essentiel à la reconstruction d’une société en harmonie avec son environnement. The Last of Us propose aussi un message critique envers la société moderne et le capitalisme, grand responsable de ce monde post-apocalyptique.

373,Sena,2,Designing Learning Activities in Minecraft for Formal Education in Geography,"Digital technology has shaped the way humans interact with information and create knowledge. These conditions have in turn shaped a generation of people who experienced virtual environments very early in their lives and are often referred to as digital natives. This group of people has a particular way of communicating and interacting. It characterizes their affinity spaces and the many experiences with virtual worlds and digital games. In digital games, the separation between entertainment and learning is becoming less pronounced. Many game titles have been used for educational purposes. An iconic example is Minecraft, which has been used formally in some schools to teach topics on the environment. However, studies on formal topics in Geography are conspicuously absent, and we therefore selected Minecraft to understand how digital natives learn about Geography given the character of its virtual environment. To this aim, we developed a learning task scenario for global climate zones. The scenario was tested in two pilot studies with two different groups of participants. The results indicate that participants already share some degree of knowledge about the game environment, despite differences within the digital native group.

376,Sutherland,1,Virtualizing the ‘good life’: reworking narratives of agrarianism and the rural idyll in a computer game,"Farming computer games enable the ‘desk chair countryside’—millions of people actively engaged in performing farming and rural activities on-line—to co-produce their desired representations of rural life, in line with the parameters set by game creators. In this paper, I critique the narratives and images of farming life expressed in the popular computer game ‘Stardew Valley’. Stardew is based on a scenario whereby players leave a [meaningless] urban desk job to revitalize the family farm. Player are given a choice to invest in the Community Center or to support ‘JojaMart’, a ‘big-box’ development. The farming narrative demonstrates the hallmarks of classical American agrarianism: farming as the basic profession on which other occupations depend, the virtue of hard work, the ‘natural’ and moral nature of agricultural life, and the economic independence of the farmer. More recent discourses of critical agrarianism are noticeably absent, particularly in relation to environmental protection. Conflict is centred on urban-based big business, whereas the farm is represented as a ‘bolt-hole’ or sanctuary from urban life. I argue that embedding issues of big-box development in gameplay enrols players in active reflection and debate on desirable responses, whereas the emphasis on reproducing classical agrarian tropes risks desensitizing game players to contemporary agrarian social and environmental justice issues. However, Stardew Valley gameplay implicitly reinforces the ideal that low input farming is the way that agriculture should be practiced. The success of the game in eliciting on-line debates, and the requirement for active performance and decision-making, demonstrates the specific potential of computer games as mediums for influencing and intervening in ongoing reworking of farming imaginaries, and enabling more critically engagement of the ‘desk chair countryside’ in important global debates.",English,117,url,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-020-10121-w,5,empirical,2020
377,Tait,1,Making Gamer Worlds in Mass Appeal Futuristic Online Games,"Online games have become massively – and unevenly – distributed across human society. While most commonly played for leisure, online games also help to raise awareness about environmental degradation and promote conservation initiatives. My research explores the popular appeal of two futuristic online games, No Man’s Sky (2016) and Sid Meiers Civilization Beyond Earth (2014). I examine gamer critiques of the visual and other spatial content—or ‘worlds’—encountered in these two games, in order to understand what kinds of ideas about nature are created, promoted and consumed in mass-appeal virtual spaces. This paper expands the study of nature 2.0—a new component of nature that exists in and through online social media—contributing to emerging research on what it means to engage with nature in the digital age. The environments in these two games are both fictional and alien, yet existing physical environments inspire virtual game spaces and are critical for a player’s successful immersion in the game. Gamers reinvent game spaces to perpetuate a game’s particular narrative or gaming objectives. Much of the imagery that gamers’ consume for other contexts, depicts a narrow or skewed framing of ‘nature’, which scholars have shown impacts real-world interventions and assumptions. I argue that gamers’ world making in virtual game spaces provides opportunities for complicating confronting and renegotiating human nature relationships.",English,105,url,https://scholarworks.uvm.edu/castheses/46,3,empirical,2017
378,Tait,2,Nonscalability and generating digital outer space natures in No Man’s Sky,"This article examines the generation of digital outer space natures in the space exploration game, No Man’s Sky. Using procedural generation, No Man’s Sky offers nearly infinite planets, flora, and fauna on the fly. With the rapid development of gaming technology and tools, game developers and others are attempting to diversify the representation of various forms of nature in gaming content and to expand the use of games in behavioral change, education, conservation, and other fields. Many scholars argue that games offer promising ways for various publics to understand their place and their interconnectedness with microbes, ecosystems, planet Earth, and beyond. We examine how No Man’s Sky struggled to coproduce digital outer space natures at the two scalar extremes of the vast expanse of outer space and of the embodied player relating within complex biomes. Our results from an in-depth, qualitative analysis of the initial version of the game, of player world-building experiences in No Man’s Sky, and of subsequent developer modifications to the game demonstrate that nonscalability theory is useful for studying what digital outer space natures do in games. We also argue that nonscalability theory would benefit from a more robust engagement with the digital. No Man’s Sky was initially scalable to such an extreme that it made players into objects without an origin story, broader purpose or way to build meaningful relations in the game. For a brief period, this game undermined players’ interplanetary colonial imaginaries. Subsequent updates to the game introduced a limited scope of nonscalability, but only to the extent of satisfying gamers’ desires to become more impactful agents of exploration. We see great potential for analyzing the role of innovations in computing and game design in linking multiscalar digital, outer, and earth spaces, which as other scholars have shown, bear significantly on our understanding of multiple worlds and natures.",English,147,url,https://doi.org/10.1177/25148486211000746,3,empirical,2022

To address this research gap, this study analyzes the in-game behaviors data of 640 players within Nintendo’s Animal Crossing: New Horizons (ACNH), as well as their environmental perceptions based on the revised New Environmental Paradigm (NEP) scale, using open data sourced and adapted from Vuong et al. [53] from the Science Data Bank repository. The obtained results revealed that players’ environmental perceptions might impact their in-game behaviors, however this is not always true; the obtained results also revealed that players might behave within the game against their beliefs and perceptions just to level-up in the game. For instance, anti-anthropocentrism players, who are environment-caring, are found to harm the nature within the game. The findings of this study can help to understand how people with different environmental perceptions might behave, hence promoting ecological behaviors. Additionally, they can also help to reveal how to design games that can emphasize environment-friendly behaviors, hence helping to achieve the sustainable development goals of United Nations (UN).",English,146,url,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.entcom.2024.100678,23,empirical,2024

The use of technology has not only supplanted people’s traditional experiences with nature but begun to change them: Through videos and documentaries, we can discover windows opened onto wilderness, landscapes, places, and species we would not be able to reach and see otherwise. Even video games contribute to this phenomenon. Can gaming play a role in the relationship between humans and nature? The current study focused on how players relate to nature in the world’s number-one online role-playing game, the World of Warcraft (WoW). We distributed an online questionnaire to 1,173 Frenchspeaking gamers to assess their preferred landscapes in the virtual environment, their relations to nature in real life, and their motivations to play. The results indicate that players prefer virtual areas displaying a significant amount of green vegetation and specific open landscapes but that this preference is not related to their connectedness with nature nor to their motivation to play, which is mostly to escape from their daily life. We showed also that people that declared being motivated to play for nature-based reasons are those that declare being less connected with nature in real life. We discuss these results as a reflection of biophilia in a virtual context, that is, an attraction to virtual landscapes that are healthy and full of vegetation, when it has become difficult to reach such landscapes in real life.",English,141,url,https://doi.org/10.1089/eco.2017.0037,40,empirical,2018
387,Villarejo-Carballido,3,Key Competences for Lifelong Learning through the “Animal Crossing: New Horizons” Video Game,"The growth and impact of video games in education at an international level is a reality. Research shows that gamers can increase their knowledge, skills, and behavioural flexibility. However, there has been no in-depth research into the relationship between current video games and the key competences for lifelong learning set out by the European Commission. This research focuses on learning acquisition through playing the popular game “Animal Crossing: New Horizons”. The Communicative Methodology has been used in this research through, on the one hand, use of the Social Impact in Social Media (SISM) method involving the analysis of 1000 comments posted on the social network Twitter and, on the other hand, through communicative inter, sanviews with five gamers and a family member of a user. The results show that the Animal Crossing video game promotes learning achievements regarding literacy, multilingualism, mathematical skills, digital competence, social skills, citizenship, entrepreneurship, and cultural awareness.",English,151,url,https://doi.org/10.3390/fi14110329,45,empirical,2022
388,Vuong,6,A Multinational Data Set of Game Players' Behaviors in a Virtual World and Environmental Perceptions,"Video gaming has been rising rapidly to become one of the primary entertainment media, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Playing video games has been reported to associate with many psychological and behavioral traits. However, little is known about the connections between game players’ behaviors in the virtual environment and environmental perceptions. Thus, the current data set offers valuable resources regarding environmental worldviews and behaviors in the virtual world of 640 Animal Crossing: New Horizons (ACNH) game players from 29 countries around the globe. The data set consists of six major categories: 1) socio-demographic profile, 2) COVID-19 concern, 3) environmental perception, 4) game playing habit, 5) in-game behavior, and 6) game-playing feeling. By making this data set open, we aim to provide policymakers, game producers, and researchers with valuable resources for understanding the interactions between behaviors in the virtual world and environmental perceptions, which could help produce video games in compliance with the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals.",English,137,url,https://doi.org/10.1162/dint_a_00111,9,empirical,2021
389,Vuong,8,On the environment-destructive probabilistic trends: A perceptual and behavioral study on video game players,"Currently, gaming is the world’s favorite form of entertainment. Various studies have shown how games impact players’ perceptions and behaviors, prompting opportunities for purposes beyond entertainment. This study uses Animal Crossing: New Horizons (ACNH)—a real-time life-simulation game—as a unique case study of how video games can affect humans’ environmental perceptions. A dataset of 584 observations from a survey of ACNH players and the Hamiltonian MCMC technique have enabled us to explore the relationship between in-game behaviors and perceptions. Here we show a probabilistic trend towards exploiting the in-game environment despite players’ perceptions, suggesting that the simplification of commercial game design may overlook opportunities to engage and educate players in pro-environmental activities.",English,219,url,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2021.101530,9,empirical,2021

391,Whittington,1,"Observant Play and Modding: The Postcolonial, Environmentalist Playthrough of Minecraft","This extended abstract, in the vein of autoethnography, reflexively analyzes an organic approach to play in Minecraft that resists extractive, colonial tendencies common to sandbox crafting games. In primary theoretical use are Melissa Kagen’s postapocalyptic pastoral to assist in my reading of the game, and Rachael Hutchinson’s observant play to dissect the playstyle and what it means to modify a game to better match or explore one’s reading of it.",English,17,url,https://dl.digra.org/index.php/dl/article/view/2249,3,empirical,2024
392,Wragg,2,Outdoor Play Mediated through Pokémon: Facing the Snorlax,"Playing outdoors in local environments provides the affordance to experience freedom, explore surroundings, challenge sensorimotor capabilities, and build personal and social skills with others. However, our growing reliance on technology can lead to an increase in sedentary behaviours, whilst the time young people play outdoors continues to decline. This decrease in time spent in outdoor play combined with the marked increase in daily sedentary activities contribute to several negative physical and mental health issues among children. In 2016, Pokémon Go became the most popular game in the history of smartphone games and was among the first games to feature geo-located augmented reality elements. This chapter employs collaborative autoethnographic methods to explore how Pokémon Go mediates active engagement in the outdoors and facilitates opportunities for outdoor play that develops key hallmarks of outdoor education, namely, active movement, inter- and intra-personal skills and local environment awareness.",English,63,url,https://doi.org/10.4324/9781003367536,5,empirical,2024

205,Ruffino,1,Nonhuman Games: Playing in the Post-Anthropocene,"This chapter explores what video games can teach us in light of the ongoing sixth mass extinction in the history of our planet, allegedly caused by global warming and the over-consumption of vital resources. Games made and played by nonhuman actors can shed light on the situatedness and partiality of our knolwedge regarding the boundaries that separate and differentiate human and nonhuman, interactivity and passivity, entertainment and boredom, and life and death. Nonhuman games help us to articulate the space and time in-between these dualisms and have the potential to re-route gaming (and game studies) from false myths of agency, interactivity, and instrumentalism, and the masculinism inherent in these notions. Nonhuman games are companions for earthly survival, and as such they can be taken as useful references when considering a more ethical apporach to the ecological crisis of the Anthropocene. The chapter investigates notions of posthumanism, interpassivity, and contemporary critiques of the early assumptions of game studies on the agency of human players. It looks at video games that play by themselves, idle and incremental eyes, and the emergence of nonplaying characters in ludic and open-world simulations. It explores forms of automatic play and the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in online role-playing games, procedurally generated virtual environments, and games that far exceed the lifespan of their players.",English,41,url,https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/978-1-83909-037-020201008/full/html,5,non_empirical,2021
