## The team

__Katie Blake__<sup>1,2</sup> is the project lead for the systematic map. She conceived of the project, designed the methodology, performed searches, screened the literature, completed the data extraction, wrote the manuscript, and supported the development of this database.

This research has been conducted as part of a DPhil project with the University of Oxford, exploring the role of commercial video games to engage with species protection. Her work focuses on both players and developers in order to fully understand the transformative potential of video games for conservation outreach.
